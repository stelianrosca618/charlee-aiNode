            <p className="mt-4">Insurance leaders are constantly trying to predict what is around the corner.&nbsp; “What don’t I see?”&nbsp; “What’s going to happen next?” “How can I prepare for the next catastrophe or the resulting tidal wave of litigation?” “How can I efficiently and effectively manage current and emerging risks?” “Are my reserves adequately set and maintained?” “What can I do to reduce the severity of claims, and control costs? “</p>
            <p className="mt-4">The ability to search for insights in the insurance claims process can help you in a number of ways to identify, predict, and take action on patterns and trends.&nbsp; This results in you having the edge in reducing claims severity and allocated loss adjustment expense. For example, what if by utilizing the latest AI and Machine Learning technology, you could correlate and model data from various sources.&nbsp; What if you could personalize searches and discover context for your business at that moment?&nbsp; Imagine the possibilities of accelerating your claims process, reducing fraud, and managing your litigation.&nbsp; That sounds great, but where do you start?</p>
