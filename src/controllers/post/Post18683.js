            <p className="mt-4">InsureTech and artificial intelligence (A.I.) have become the new buzz words and mantra in the insurance industry.&nbsp; Creativity and innovation is thriving in Silicon Valley with over 1,600 technology companies in the InsureTech space for underwriting and claims.&nbsp; If you remember, back in the 1990s, experts predicted that if your company was not an internet company, you would not be around in the near future.&nbsp; That prediction came true, but what about the current prediction that artificial intelligence for claims will change the insurance industry?&nbsp; I believe that it will, and now is the time to stake your claim for the future.</p>
            <p className="mt-4">For the last few decades, insurance companies have yielded massive amounts of data (big-data).&nbsp; We know that a robust A.I. system for insurance claims needs a lot of data to thrive and perform. Since you have the data, how can you start to leverage it and improve your business performance and outcomes?&nbsp; The Infinilytics platform, smartC™, can deliver fast and accurate results for your claims process, and improve your customers’ claims experience.</p>
