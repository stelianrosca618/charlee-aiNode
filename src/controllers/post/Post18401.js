      <p className="mt-4"> The insurance industry is facing major disruptions on how products are sold in the marketplace, how claims are being received, the increasing on-demand services by customers, and the ever increasing amount of data available (internal and external) for the business process. &nbsp;The Internet of Things (IoT), and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, are two of the main catalysts causing disruption in the industry.</p>
      <p className="mt-4">We need to rethink how products are brought to the marketplace, how claims are processed, and how we communicate with the on-demand generation, which is now the majority of our population.</p>
      <p className="mt-4">The key to success is the ability to have multiple analysis techniques to discover and leverage claims and underwriting data to make better decisions. &nbsp;Are you leveraging claim patterns with the underwriting process? &nbsp;Are you enriching data with your underwriting process to gain a better measurement of risk? &nbsp;Next generation analytics, combined with dynamic modeling, is a great start to lead your company into the future.</p>
