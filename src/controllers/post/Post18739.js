            <p className="mt-4">Infinilytics is proud to announce that we have completed the requirements for a Service Organization Control (SOC) 2, Type I Audit covering our SaaS product. Specifically geared toward SaaS and other technology companies with a focus on security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and privacy, the SOC 2 standard best meets the demands of User Entities requiring third-party assurance over information security controls in place at Service Organizations. This extensive reporting standard provides independent validation that Infinilytics’ internal control environment operates in accordance with the selected American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) trust services principles and criteria. Members of Armanino’s* dedicated Risk Assurance Practice completed the SOC 2 audit verifying that Infinilytics’ processes and internal controls are designed appropriately, to meet all the requirements for the AICPA Security, Availability and Confidentiality criteria.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p className="mt-4">In future months, Infinilytics will be actively working toward our SOC 2, Type II Report, to demonstrate to our customers that our controls are not only properly designed, but that they operate effectively over time to meet the SOC 2 security, availability and confidentiality Trust Services Principles.</p>
