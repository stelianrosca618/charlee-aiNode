                <strong>&nbsp;</strong>The last several months have caused the insurance industry to change in so many ways. Some insurance companies are reporting a decline in revenue while others are maintaining or have increased.&nbsp; The pandemic, hurricanes, and wildfires cause turmoil in the claims systems with backlogs, delayed payment processing, lack of claims resources, and perennial charlatans and fraudsters. They always emerge in these catastrophes preying on victims and insurance carriers.

                <strong>Automation for the Claims Process</strong>
            </h4>
            <p className="mt-4">Charlee provides fraud and litigation predictions in the form of flags and a score. The claims are scored (0-100) at the first notice of loss and vary based on the severity and number of flags. The score refreshes every time the claim receives new information such as a document, recorded statements, and third-party party reports. Based on the score, you can assign specific ones to senior or specialist adjusters for fair resolutions and cost-efficient process.</p>

                <strong>Benefits of A.I. in the Automated Claims Process</strong>

            <p className="mt-4">Imagine being able to reduce costs and save money on needlessly processing claims while still providing superior customer service.
