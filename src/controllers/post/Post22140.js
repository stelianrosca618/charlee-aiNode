            <p className="mt-4">‘It is always at the start that the momentum in sport is created,’ goes an often repeated saying. The beginning and pace at which a sport is set is where champions are made, championships are won, and careers get going. Track and field enthusiasts know how positive outcomes get a sprinter out of the blocks when the starter’s pistol shot is fired or how a swimmer’s lead in a race is set based on the kind of edge they can establish during the first lap. In claims management, the first few hours after an accident, a calamity, or loss provide the vital period required to gather data, establish facts, and chalk the incident’s trajectory, setting the tone for the entire claims management cycle to unfold. This phase, called The First Notice of Loss (FNOL), must be flawless in gathering data and establishing what and how the incident happened, communicating the next steps to the customer, and assessing all possible exposures or applicable coverages.</p>

            <h3 className="mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold">THE IMPORTANCE OF FNOL</h3>
            <p className="mt-4">The first time the claimant informs the insurer of a loss, is when it is considered ‘making a claim.’ This is when the lifecycle of a formal claim begins and is very crucial both for the claimant and insurer. In the case of the former, it establishes the result of the policy the claimant has paid for and whether his claim will be dealt with swiftly, immediately, and within an adequate response time. In the case of the latter, it is a chance for the insurer to prove or validate their reputation in handling the claims quickly, ensuring a good resolution and justified settlement.</p>
            <p className="mt-4">Registering an FNOL requires the insurer to submit critical information – policy number, date and time of the loss, incident location, police report number, a personal account of how the incident occurred, and insurance information of the other party where required. In the case of a car accident, details given to an FNOL representative will include all the above, as well as questions about the nature and severity of the damage, history of the claimant, other driver’s testimony, police reports, witness accounts, medical report if any, observed damage to vehicles, etc.</p>

            <h3 className="mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INSIGHTS – THE GAME CHANGER</h3>
            <p className="mt-4">In any incident report and subsequent investigation, the basics must be addressed: Who? What? When? Why? Where? And How? For the FNOL to be complete, this essential data must be registered and admitted into the claims management system accurately and efficiently. This is where AI’s intervention phase has come to achieve vast significance. AI’s pattern recognition software and ability to derive deep insights based on past claims patterns from structured and unstructured data – claims notes, documents, third-party PDFs, and news articles – is helping configure unique insights that were hitherto often missed during claims registration. The gathering of such information is helping insurers predict claims trajectories in advance, allowing them to monitor the pulse of the allegations and the direction they are going in, and, from a business perspective, helping in better reserves management, risk assessment, and observation of annual trends.</p>

            <p className="mt-4">Brad Metzger, having worked in the P&amp;C Industry for several years across Claims Operations, Claims Strategy, and Claims IT, has first-hand experience of the impact of AI during FNOL. Having observed the insurance industry for over two decades and observing the criticality of data insights by AI intervention in claims management, he sheds light on why FNOL standardization using NLP-led AI engines can make the claims management process sharper, better, and more intelligent.</p>
