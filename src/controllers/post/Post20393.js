            <h3 class="mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold">How Artificial Intelligence Can Help</h3>
            <p className="mt-4">Artificial intelligence is ubiquitous in our daily lives. Smartwatch? Smartphone? Google? Amazon? FaceBook? LinkedIn? YouTube? Instagram? You get the idea! These platforms run on sophisticated algorithms, which data scientists constantly monitor for insights to advertise, acquire customers, and improve customer engagement. Artificial intelligence is still in its infancy stages, but with the advancements in data science and natural language processing (NLP), some remarkable things are happening in InsureTech.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold">Embrace InsureTech</h3>
            <p className="mt-4">
                <span className="font-normal">Artificial intelligence is a force multiplier for time management and critical decision-making in the business of insurance.&nbsp; Imagine being able to quickly learn about priority claims identified as likely high risk with severe damages. Then, you could take immediate steps to mitigate the severity and thereby reduce expenses. For example, what could you do if A.I. predicted the likelihood that a claim would end up litigated several weeks before an attorney is involved in the lawsuit? Imagine the cost and expense savings by avoiding costly legal proceedings with possible unfavorable verdicts. Insurance executives can be more agile, responsive, and successful with an A.I. solution with NLP guiding with the right insights.</span>
