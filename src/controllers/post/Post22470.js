      <p className="mt-4">Over the past 100 years, the insurance industry, built on legacy systems, has stood as a bulwark against changing times, economic upheavals, volatile market conditions, and a fast-changing society of people with growing demands, greater access to information, and increasing knowledge about traditional instruments. Consolidated over time to safeguard people’s interests and governed by rules and regulations put in place whenever the need arose, processes and workflows developed through trial and error have led insurers to design their standardized systems for different workflows: management of claims, detection of fraud, litigation, and reserves management.</p>

      <p className="mt-4">However, what was once a significant insurance driver has now become the barrier that holds insurers back: legacy systems. These aging infrastructures, deeply embedded in the organization’s fabric, have become rigid and fragmented over time, entailing repetitive processes and workflows that are in critical need of overhaul. Most importantly, these legacy systems prevent insurers from fully embracing the power of new InsureTech initiatives like AI to simplify and streamline processes, eliminate manual labor, reduce repetitive tasks, ensure speedier claims processing, and optimize insurers’ ever-increasing payouts.</p>
      <p className="mt-4">A recent McKinsey report shows that effectively leveraging predictive analytics, generative AI, and Agentic AI could deliver up to $1.1 trillion in annual value to the insurance industry. However, incorporating technology can be challenging since insurance is one of the oldest and data-heavy sectors. While many insurers have evolved from basic ERP platforms to more modern systems, some with limited scalability, they still face additional challenges that must be addressed when managing legacy systems.</p>
      
      <h3 className="mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold">The Reality: Legacy Systems Are Not Built for AI</h3>
      <p className="mt-4">Legacy core systems were designed for stability and compliance, not for flexibility or the data-intensive demands of AI. The key issues include:</p>
      <ul class="mt-4 list-disc list-outside pl-6">
        <li>
          <b>Data Silos and Poor Data Quality</b>: 70% of insurers report that siloed data is a top obstacle to AI adoption (source: McKinsey, 2024). Obtaining a single customer view can be challenging, as policyholders’ information is stored in bits and bytes across different systems, lacking a consolidated view of past histories, behavioral patterns, and continuity of narratives.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Limited Scalability</b>: Legacy systems struggle to support new technologies or scale with increasing demands. While the industry is changing, their pace of adaptation remains slow and cumbersome, leading to bottlenecks in managing workflows. This, coupled with manually driven processes, especially in data gathering, prevents insurers from keeping pace with the industry’s transformation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Complexity in Modernizing</b>: Insurers may find it costly or overwhelming to modernize or replace legacy systems. With tight budgets and financial outflows into other business areas, the need for modernization can seem daunting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Security Vulnerabilities</b>: Older security frameworks may not address today’s cybersecurity demands when integrating AI models that access sensitive data. Additionally, decades of patchwork upgrades create a burden, making updates more expensive and complex.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Without addressing these barriers, AI initiatives may falter, fail to scale, or even expose insurers to regulatory and operational risks.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4"> 
        However, modernizing intelligently—even incrementally—can unlock AI’s full potential, leading to better decision-making, quicker claims resolutions, and enhanced customer experiences.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold">What Legacy Systems Must Understand to Integrate AI Effectively</h3>
