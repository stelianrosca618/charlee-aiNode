    "content": "InsurTech - Fast Tracking Claims; Remember Your Government Compliance Mandates\n\nEarlier this month, we attended and participated in the 2016 InsurTech Connect Conference in Las Vegas.  It was a great event in that we were able to collaborate and connect with some brilliant innovators in the world of insurance technology.  A couple of things resonated with us regarding the InsurTech paradigm; one, technology advances are created at lightening speed; two, government compliance mandates for the insurance industry are being ignored, or people are not aware of them.\n\nThe on demand generation expects to only click the button once (smart-phone, tablet, watch, etc.) and expects same day shipping and next day delivery of the product. This is quickly becoming the norm, and will speed up as the technologies and market capabilities improve.  So how do your customers perceive the business of insurance?  How can you deliver the on-demand expectations and meet, and exceed, government mandated laws and regulations for the business of insurance?\n\nRecently, a friend of ours complained about a bad experience with their insurance company. It was noted that insurance companies were quick and efficient in taking insurance premiums, but not delivering on their promise to pay claims made us wonder. She was unaware that a claims organization spends more than 60 percent of their time in collecting data from various sources looking for questionable patterns.  After that process is completed, only then is the settlement or payment made.\n\nInsurance companies must be cautious about the discovered fraud patterns while recognizing that the genuine claims must be paid on time.  A dilemma such as: “To Pay Or Not To Pay,” is mitigated with years of behavioral analysis experience, coupled with the collection, aggregation, and analysis of all of the required data.  A claim paid too soon might have fraud throughout the information submitted by the claimants or policy holder.  Settling this type of claim too quickly increases costs of the claim, which in turn, impacts your customers’ premium. On the other hand, a claim paid too slow might bring compliance, litigation, and customer churn issues.  Can technology solve this problem? Can advanced analytics help? Yes!\n\nThe right technologies can solve the problem of data aggregation, big data solutions and tools, and various platforms and solutions for infrastructure, security, data storage, data transmission, and data processing. The real value in the insurance domain is specific algorithms that can intelligently comb through the data using the infrastructure, tools and technologies to separate the genuine and questionable patterns.

This is quickly becoming the norm, and will speed up as the technologies and market capabilities improve.&nbsp; So how do your customers perceive the business of insurance?&nbsp; How can you deliver the on-demand expectations and meet, and exceed, government mandated laws and regulations for the business of insurance?</p>\r\n      <p className=\"mt-4\">Recently, a friend of ours complained about a bad experience with their insurance company. It was noted that insurance companies were quick and efficient in taking insurance premiums, but not delivering on their promise to pay claims made us wonder. She was unaware that a claims organization spends more than <u>60 percent</u> of their time in collecting data from various sources looking for questionable patterns.&nbsp; After that process is completed, only then is the settlement or payment made. </p>\r\n      <p className=\"mt-4\">Insurance companies must be cautious about the discovered fraud patterns while recognizing that the genuine claims must be paid on time.&nbsp; A dilemma such as: <strong>\r\n          <em>“To Pay Or Not To Pay,”</em>\r\n        </strong> is mitigated with years of behavioral analysis experience, coupled with the collection, aggregation, and analysis of all of the required data.&nbsp; A claim paid too soon might have fraud throughout the information submitted by the claimants or policy holder.&nbsp; Settling this type of claim too quickly increases costs of the claim, which in turn, impacts your customers’ premium. On the other hand, a claim paid too slow might bring compliance, litigation, and customer churn issues.&nbsp; Can technology solve this problem? Can advanced analytics help? Yes! </p>\r\n      <p className=\"mt-4\">The right technologies can solve the problem of data aggregation, big data solutions and tools, and various platforms and solutions for infrastructure, security, data storage, data transmission, and data processing. The real value in the insurance domain is specific algorithms that can intelligently comb through the data using the infrastructure, tools and technologies to separate the genuine and questionable patterns. This process will eliminate the fraudulent claim payouts, and ensure the fast tracking of claims.&nbsp; As a result, compliance mandates will be met, your genuine customers will be satisfied, which will result in the growth of your book of business</p>\r\n    </div>"

CEOs, Sr. V.P.s, Directors, Managers, Supervisors, and line level professionals are hoping that the emerging technology will improve customer satisfaction, increase sales in the marketplace, and streamline and reduce the costs of processing claims. A valuable asset to your business process is the ability to identify patterns in your data (internal ﬁrst, and then external data), which will then allow you to have better insight and decision making. Remember: Right Data, at the Right Time, to the Right Person, for the Right Decision. Artificial intelligence (A.I.), or machine learning, can leverage the knowledge and skills of your team into automated computing processes thereby reducing the amount of time in gathering data, organizing the data, analyzing the data, and then present it in a clear and concise view for timely decisions.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nImagine your claims representative missing the patterns of an organized enterprise preying on your claims system. What about the nefarious individual masking questionable activities in the policy application (life, property and casualty, workers’ compensation, automobile)? How can you gain a clear vision of the future trends in litigation issues of claims (residential and commercial, non-standard automobile, workers’ compensation, life and indemnity, disability, etc.) What about a district attorney’s office bringing a three year, highly sophisticated, $120 million healthcare fraud case to trial with the need to analyze mountains of documents and evidence for trial? Advanced analytics with machine learning is key to answering these questions. Understanding how and where A.I. can be deployed in your analytics and business processes might appear to be a daunting task, but it is not with the proper strategy.\n\nA.I. Deﬁned for Insurance\n\nThe following technologies are the foundation of a robust advanced analytics platform:\nKnowledge Engineering: Basically, knowledge engineering is utilized to analyze data, models, and business rules (heuristics) into applications to solve complex problems which human beings have done for some time. Remember, the goal is to automate the process of gathering and analyzing data much more efficiently and quickly. For example, ICD 9 and 10 codes in medical records; pharmaceutical codes for medications and narcotics; weather patterns; commercial and residential building registers, or the national death register. Reducing the time spent on gathering routine information can lead to better decision making by your staff, and reduce costs.Natural Language Processing: NLP is utilized to understand the meaning of words in conversations, both audio and written text. NLP combined with machine learning will allow you to discover patterns within your claims and underwriting data streams, and build powerful predictive models. For example, initial claim forms (FNOL, CMS1500, State workers’ compensation forms, etc.); claim investigation notes and reports; social media posts (mainstream media and public records); medical billings and reports.Machine Learning: Tools, techniques, and algorithms are the bedrock of machine learning and critical in identifying patterns in your data. Machine learning is key in deploying advanced analytics for your underwriting, claims, and marketing operations. Connecting the silos of information is critical in the predictive analysis of your business process.Image Analysis: Image analysis basically identifies objects, locations, events, and individuals in photographs and video. Imagine the possibilities of receiving a live video stream of an area just destroyed in a catastrophic weather event or firestorm. What about photographs of vehicles used over and over in multiple false claims (each time masking the true identification of the vehicle, both VIN and license plate)? A robust image analysis solution can help validate genuine claims, and stop the fraudulent ones before a payment is issued.Sensory Perception: The Internet of Things (IoT), which is really Data of Things, will grow exponentially due to smart phones, smart devices (i.e., the smart home). It is estimated that by 2020, each person will have several devices connected together with the IoT. This is a significant amount of data that can be gleaned and analyzed in the business of insurance and risk management. The sensory data needs to have the right context for meaningful analysis. Advanced analytics is key to make sense of the IoT.The True Value of A.I. for Insurance\n\nEarlier this year I was honored to speak at the Silicon Valley Insurance Accelerator Q3 Symposium on A.I. for claims. One of the attendees asked a great question: “Will A.I. replace the human in the claims process?” The short answer is; No! Many laws and regulations governing the business of insurance would need to be modified, and or created. The true value of A.I. in the claims, marketing, and underwriting processes is the automation of mundane tasks. It is estimated that agents spend 80 percent of their time gathering data on a prospective customer, 10 percent on administrative tasks, and 10 percent of the time on analyzing the potential risk of the new business. Claims personnel mirror the same percentages. If you automate the data gathering, the organization of it, and then apply specific advanced analytics to your business process, success will follow. You can lower the adjusted loss expenses claims (ALE), reduce the time currently expended in gathering and data, and streamline your business process.\n\nNext month, we will introduce the concept of connecting the senses used in the human interaction for the business of insurance. Cognitive computing begins with connecting basic senses to A.I.\n\nSeasons greetings and happy holidays from the Inﬁnilytics team!",

    "content": "\nInsureTech and artificial intelligence (A.I.) have become the new buzz words and mantra in the insurance industry.  Creativity and innovation is thriving in Silicon Valley with over 1,600 technology companies in the InsureTech space for underwriting and claims.  If you remember, back in the 1990s, experts predicted that if your company was not an internet company, you would not be around in the near future.  That prediction came true, but what about the current prediction that artificial intelligence for claims will change the insurance industry?  I believe that it will, and now is the time to stake your claim for the future.\n\nFor the last few decades, insurance companies have yielded massive amounts of data (big-data).  We know that a robust A.I. system for insurance claims needs a lot of data to thrive and perform. Since you have the data, how can you start to leverage it and improve your business performance and outcomes?  The Infinilytics platform, smartC™, can deliver fast and accurate results for your claims process, and improve your customers’ claims experience.\n\nThe Infinilytics advanced analytics platform: smartC™ has machine learning and over 170 patent pending algorithms with robotic process automation (RPA) which identifies more than 120 common insurance fraud schemes.  The smartC™ solution qualifies a genuine claim quickly and accurately while identifying questionable patterns in other claims.  The smartC™ solution is created and developed for all lines of insurance business.  One of the most contemporary A.I. solutions for claims is litigation prediction.  Imagine the capability of predicting with a 90 percent accuracy rate if a claim is going to fall into litigation.  Your claims team would be able to take immediate steps to mitigate the litigation, customer service would be greatly enhanced, and your claims costs would be reduced.  The smartC™ solution can quickly take you into this best practice for claims.\n\nA great example and success story one of our property and casualty customers is in the anti-fraud and litigation disciplines.  Our client utilizing smartC™ was able to:\nImpact loss adjustment expensesReduce the time to settle a claimIdentify suspected fraudulent claims with A.I. pattern matchingUtilize sentiment and emotion analysis for litigation predictions\nThe smartC™ solution starts to analyze your claims data from the first notice of loss (FNOL) all the way up to the settlement or denial of the claim.  The smartC™ solution never stops working for your claims team.  Within six to eight months, our client experienced:\nImproved business automationImproved data analyticsGained better customer insightsImproved efficiencies in their claims operationsCreated and delivered a better customer and claims experience\nInsurance companies have a vast amount of data.  We need to leverage the data and transform the claims process into an efficient and cost effective business model.  The Infinilytics smartC™ platform will allow you to quickly bring artificial intelligence into your claims process. The insurance marketplace is very competitive and constantly changing.   Infinilytics and the smartC™ platform with artificial intelligence will make you very competitive and more profitable.",

    "content": "The time tested axiom in risk management: “If it’s predictable, it’s preventable”[1], holds true today in the business of property and casualty insurance claims. What’s really amazing is that we can take that axiom and energize it with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. In 2017, the Infinilytics Team deployed the smartC™ solution for a property and casualty carrier to mitigate rising claims costs for the catastrophic storms which devastated the Gulf States. One of the successful outcomes was predicting if a claim was going to be litigated. The proof of concept revealed how the carrier saved over $10 million dollars with a litigation prediction solution.\n\nThere is a great deal of information contained within the first notice of loss (FNOL), claims representative notes, interviews, and statements by the insured and claimant. A domain expert can glean a lot from this unstructured data and make effective predictions such as the likelihood of the claim going into litigation and indications of organized activity. Replicating the above process in software is a challenging task. Most machine learning models perform poorly or become biased in the presence of skewed data.\n\n\n\nLess than ten percent of a carrier’s claims typically end up in litigation or become extremely severe. However, that ten percent claims have the biggest impact on the company's bottom line. Accurately identifying those claims early in the process can save the carrier millions of dollars. This requires novel approaches using a combination of various artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML) techniques and most importantly EXPERT SYSTEMS KNOWLEDGE-BASE.\n\nThe Infinilytics advanced analytics solution with artificial intelligence (smartC™) is comprised of several AI solutions, including machine learning, NLP, and Expert Systems. Our Thought Leadership Team has over 60 years of experience in reviewing and investigating thousands of claim files for all types of insurance fraud schemes. Infinilytics leverages the domain expertise into the expert AI systems with the goal of replicating the expert’s knowledge and skills. Infinilytics’ smartC™ captures the expert's knowledge into its database. The smartC™ solution also learns of new behavior patterns from the corpus of claims using unsupervised learning techniques along with its built-in expert system. This hybrid approach of using machine learning along with expert knowledge base helps smartC™ build a strong context around its analysis and perform accurate predictions like an expert. In our proof of concept, smartC™ was able to predict litigation before the claim actually went into litigation.\n\n \n\nImagine if you could do the following:\n\n1) Predict with a 90 percent accuracy if a claim will fall into litigation upon receipt of the first notice of loss.\n\n2) Take immediate steps to prevent the claim from falling into litigation.\n\n3) Significantly reducing your litigation costs by taking action before it is too late.\n\n4) Keep your customers satisfied with their claims experience, and further increase your book of business.\n\nThe Infinilytics Team with their smartC™ solution can help your team achieve these outcomes.\n\nContact the team at: www.infinilytics.com, or info@infinilytics.com, or (844) 826-6906.\n\n[1]http://www.gordongraham.com/philosophy.html",

    "content": "Hello World 2.0!  In a short amount of time suddenly everyone is working remotely.  Indeed, there are a lot of people who work for global corporations and have mastered meetings through Zoom, Skype, etc. and odd hours working with their virtual colleagues and customers.  However, your claims team is probably working remotely right now, and may be struggling to meet deadlines in processing claims. The vast majority of companies are not set up or equipped to suddenly deploy their workforce in a remote environment. How can you maintain control, service customers and be successful in managing a claims team in a remote environment? Communicate, collaborate, cooperate, and leverage artificial intelligence into your claims process right now.\n\nFirst Things First\n\nThe vast majority of insurance companies claims teams are not ready to move in masse into a remote working environment.  Of course, there are people who do work outside of the office, but they are the minority. How do leaders and managers make the sudden shift? How do you ease anxiety and continually connect and collaborate with co-workers, external stakeholders, and valuable customers? How do you implement current and new business best practices? First, let’s get a few things sorted out and in proper working order.\nInfrastructure (company laptop or desktop computer, secured VPN, all necessary security safeguards for PII and HIPAA data, conference and meeting platforms).Prioritize who needs equipment.Training (in addition to knowledge and skills to use the computer and company software, learn how to use the various conference programs as companies use various products).Deadlines must be achieved (current State laws and regulations for the business of insurance are still in effect).Daily team launches (Managers must stay in contact with their teams and provide easy access for questions. Ensure your team member does not become isolated and stop communicating).Establish best practices for a new way of communication and engagement (establish a way to stay connected formally and informally. What will be missed is the ease of collaboration as there are no water coolers, coffee stations, or lunches for your team to gather with each other).Identify critical areas where remote work can be highly challenging (e.g. field adjusters, on-site engineers, mentoring juniors) and adopt technology and artificial intelligence solutions to address them.Recommendations:\nCreate a routine at home that provides for remote work (get-up, get dressed, create a comfortable work space)Flexibility is critical with the family at home. This is one of the best benefits of remote work (no commute, and flexible hours)Managers must trust their teams are working (trust but verify with CMS and other technologies)Ordinarily, productivity does not get affected with remote work on a normal basis. In fact, it will probably go up.Remote work is learned skill, provide coaching and resources on how to do itBe disciplined!\nVirtual work is not a new idea.  People in the global corporate world and government sectors have been doing it for a while. What will be missed and immediately noticed is the skill of structuring unstructured time (informal water cooler time or the manager walking the floor and chatting with people).\n\nThe Pandemic Impact on Customers and Insurers\n\nKey points to consider:\nSurvival and impact. Business interruption claims and lawsuits will spike. Traditionally, business interruption coverage is a necessary coverage for business owners (think of natural catastrophic incidents, mandatory evacuations resulting in business closed for a period of time). Small businesses may not survive and will file claims even though pandemics are not covered.  Pressure will be brought to bear by elected representatives attempting to force the insurance industry to honor claims for heretofore specifically excluded perils.Emergency government actions. Numerous Department of Insurance commissioners and directors have already issued calls for data regarding the business interruption claims. This is common before hearings and subsequent laws and regulations are developed and enacted.Claims investigation challenges. Claims examiners and outside appraisers and adjusters may not be able to physically inspect locations, vehicles, and damaged property. What are the virtual alternatives to this essential part of claims investigations?  Currently, there is a “Stay Home” order in effect throughout the country. Does your claims team have access to technologies that allow inspections and fact finding from your examiner’s home office? Meanwhile, the clock is still ticking to receive, process, and settle claims.Customer service.  The end to end customer service experience needs to be digital, starting from claims intake to claims processing to settlement. With high volumes expected, especially business interruption and stress claims, digital processing and use of AI technology to speed up claims processing is critical to manage customer experience.COVID-19 Insurance Scams on the Rise\n\nThe Coalition Against Insurance Fraud[1], and the National Insurance Crime Bureau[2] recently published a list of the different types of insurance fraud schemes utilizing the Covid-19 Pandemic.\n\nFraud Warning Signs:\nRobocalls, plus text and email phishing attacks can pitch false insurance deals to consumers of all ages. These pitches may ask consumers to pay insurance premiums, without delivering coverage.COVID-19 insurance cons also can work to steal people's medical and financial identities.\nThese insurance-related scams are just starting to show up, and early warning is crucial to self-defense. Insurance scams could spread rapidly as scam artists seek new ways to prey on people's anxiety about health preparedness and social isolation.\n\nConsumers should watch closely insurance-related scams such as:\nScammers are pitching low-cost \"coronavirus\" or \"COVID-19\" health coverage. They promise full coverage at affordable prices. Robocalls falsely claim to be legitimate, mainstream insurance companies. People are asked to call a toll-free number; a trained marketer may try to sell coverage. Clicking a link to the so-called insurer may load malware.Free vaccines, special virus tests or kits. Con artists are pitching free vaccines and tests, claiming they're covered by health insurance. They're just attempts to steal the victim's identity.Senior scams. Seniors are being targeted by COVID-19 robocalls and other scams that sell Vaccines, tests, \"Senior Care Packages\" and other frauds are being aggressively pitched. Scammers ask for the seniors' Medicare numbers, SSNs and other information to make false claims against their Medicare account.Bogus agents. “Cold-callers” and spam emails claiming to be from insurance agents may pitch false COVID-19 insurance policies. Scammers even have approached residents at senior housing and assisted-living facilities for Medicare ruses.False insurance cancelation. Callers urgently say a loved one is sick in the hospital with COVID-19. Your health insurance was cancelled, the caller says. You can pay over the phone to reinstate coverage and receive needed treatment.Bogus travel insurance.Be wary of pitches for travel insurance that claim to cover coronavirus-related trip cancellations. Most standard travel insurance policies don't cover viral outbreaks or pandemics.With the surge in the use of virtual calls and meetings, hackers are attempting to take advantage of businesses and consumers.Remote Claims Submission and Adjustment Technologies\n\nIn a remote environment, it is harder for the claims manager to monitor the adjusters’ work. Claims examiners and adjusters may not have quick access to documents and to their managers if they have questions. In such a scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) is a great tool that can help detect patterns and point out things to pay attention to that might get missed. AI can provide various recommendations and alerts that help the adjusters work more effectively in a remote environment. AI can also help predict things such as which claims are likely to go into litigation, so the legal team can focus on them. AI based insights is key in a remote environment.\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Solutions for Claims Processing, Investigation and Litigation\n\n \n\nAI solutions will help and yield a great return on investment (ROI) at every stage of the claims process. For example;\nChatbots can help with claims intake and manage the volume of claims.Fast tracking solutions can help quickly identify which claims can be fast tracked right at First Notice of Loss (FNOL).Recommendation Engines, such as Infinilytics’ Charlee™[3], can provide recommendations starting from FNOL to ensure compliance and best practices.AI can detect potential suspicious patterns and alert the adjuster quickly, and enable fast routing of claims.Litigation prediction, one of the things Charlee is good at, can help prioritize claims for the legal team to focus on; and help identify new patterns leading to litigation and increased costs.Digitalization of payments with EFT and blockchain technology can help ensure secure and fast payments to the claimant on genuine claims, and manage customer experience.\nNow, more than ever, it is very important to ensure your claims process is AI enabled and digitalized.\n\n \n\nBuilding and Presenting a Response Plan\n\nLeaders never waste a crisis.  Now is the time to be bold and take steps to gain control of your new working environment. The Rule of Three doctrine for problem solving and strategic planning can assist you in getting things started.\n\nProblem Solving\nCooperateCommunicateCollaborate\nStrategic Planning:\nState the Problem.Define the Possibilities.Execute\nPlease contact us at: info@infinilytics.com, or (844) 826-6906.\n\n \n\n[1]http://www.insurancefraud.org, [2]https://www.nicb.org, [3] www.infinilytics.com",

    "content": "\n\nInfinilytics’ Charlee™ Search Brings Insights on Multiple Levels\n\nIf you could search your claims database for insights that will allow you to reduce indemnity and loss adjustment expense, what would you search for?  Basic insights<1> can be mined from the structured data fields in your claims management system. But what about the vast amounts of information in the unstructured text in claim and policy files? How do you obtain these insights? Harnessing artificial intelligence machine learning with a semantic search engine can bring these valuable insights that are missed by claims management systems.\n\nIntroducing the Charlee™ Search Insights Engine for Insurance\n\nInfinilytics has built the first insurance insights engine<1> for the insurance industry. An insights engine is a powerful tool to extract insights from a variety of structured and unstructured data. The Charlee™ Search insights engine was trained on over 35 million claims and has 40,000 + insights ready to go when deployed. The Infinilytics Team has created and built the required ontology<2> for the insurance claims process.  There is also a powerful semantic search capability for words and phrases utilized in categorizing the types of loss, causes of loss, and the unique characteristics for each type of claim in each line of business.\n\nOne of the most powerful things you can do with artificial intelligence analytics is the speed and accuracy of analyzing the millions of data points within your claims system and discovering the patterns and trends contributing to high cost claims.\n\nFor example, the traditional “soft tissue injury” can be one of the most expensive claims and lead to high settlements and litigation if it is not correctly processed.  Let’s explore how the Charlee™ Search Insights Engine can bring value to your claims process by reducing allocated loss adjustment expenses, and litigation costs associated with these types of claims.\n\nHow does Charlee Search work?\n\nA typical challenge that most claims managers face is to identify risk exposure patterns. These patterns are often hidden in unstructured data (claim notes, documents, etc.), which makes analytics on these topics very challenging. Charlee, with its pre-built models and artificial intelligence, automatically extracts entities, topics and patterns from unstructured data. The Charlee™ Search automatically aggregates these patterns and provides users the ability to start with simple Google-like searches with machine learning to identify loss drivers, fraud and litigation patterns. The pending claims that exhibit these patterns can very quickly be assigned to a senior team member or SIU.  In addition, as appropriate, reserves can be adjusted, fraud investigated and litigation managed effectively.\n\nCracking the Insight Shell\n\nLet’s take a look at one of the most common and expensive loss types...soft tissue injuries.  Muscle strain and sprain injuries to the neck and back can be caused by a wide variety of traumatic events, whether as a result of an automobile accident or accidental injury to a visitor in your home or a customer in your business.  The Charlee™ Search solution allows managers to examine the frequency and severity of such claims, quickly identify the key topics and events in these claims that make them expensive, plus identify associated entities (i.e., law firms, medical providers, possible fraud rings, etc.) that are preying on your company.\n\nThe Charlee™ Search solution has the ability to graphically show loss trends, severity and much more, in a highly customizable format tailored to your needs.  It can also perform comparative analysis on a carrier’s closed claims data against open claim data!\n\nThe Charlee™ Search solution gives the claims management team important historical data insights that can assist in prioritizing current claims resource assignments.  For example, if a specific law firm consistently shows up in minor impact or otherwise low-level soft tissue injury claims, but the settlement and litigation costs are disproportionally high, a more senior level claims examiner can be assigned at the outset of any current or future claims involving these parties, thereby effectively managing overall claim costs.  Once Charlee™ Search solution is added to your claims management system you will be able to apply its powerful insights at scale, thereby reducing applicable indemnity costs, lower allocated adjustment expense and streamline your claims process.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nNow is the time to place the Charlee™ Search solution on top of your claims repository to discover the insights which have been hiding from plain sight.  Contact us at info@infinilytics.com or: (844) 826-6906 to schedule a demonstration of Charlee™.\n\n<1> Insights engine defined: https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3961025/magic-quadrant-for-insight-engines<2> An ontology for artificial intelligence specific for insurance is the knowledge base (business expert) combined with models and unique knowledge representation that powers machine learning algorithms and the search engine.\n\n<1> The word insight describes a deep understanding of a person or thing. Insurance insights can be described as a system of data points derived from structured and unstructured data revealing patterns of activity in topics, entities, and events.\n\n",

The Charlee™ Search automatically aggregates these patterns and provides users the ability to start with simple Google-like searches with machine learning to identify loss drivers, fraud and litigation patterns. The pending claims that exhibit these patterns can very quickly be assigned to a senior team member or SIU.&nbsp; In addition, as appropriate, reserves can be adjusted, fraud investigated and litigation managed effectively.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                <strong>Cracking the Insight Shell</strong>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Let’s take a look at one of the most common and expensive loss types…soft tissue injuries.&nbsp; Muscle strain and sprain injuries to the neck and back can be caused by a wide variety of traumatic events, whether as a result of an automobile accident or accidental injury to a visitor in your home or a customer in your business.&nbsp; The Charlee™ Search solution allows managers to examine the frequency and severity of such claims, quickly identify the key topics and events in these claims that make them expensive, plus identify associated entities (i.e., law firms, medical providers, possible fraud rings, etc.) that are preying on your company.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">The Charlee™ Search solution has the ability to graphically show loss trends, severity and much more, in a highly customizable format tailored to your needs.&nbsp; It can also perform comparative analysis on a carrier’s closed claims data against open claim data!</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">The Charlee™ Search solution gives the claims management team important historical data insights that can assist in prioritizing current claims resource assignments.&nbsp; For example, if a specific law firm consistently shows up in minor impact or otherwise low-level soft tissue injury claims, but the settlement and litigation costs are disproportionally high, a more senior level claims examiner can be assigned at the outset of any current or future claims involving these parties, thereby effectively managing overall claim costs.&nbsp; Once Charlee™ Search solution is added to your claims management system you will be able to apply its powerful insights at scale, thereby reducing applicable indemnity costs, lower allocated adjustment expense and streamline your claims process.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                <strong>Moving Forward</strong>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Now is the time to place the Charlee™ Search solution on top of your claims repository to discover the insights which have been hiding from plain sight.&nbsp; Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:info@infinilytics.com\">info@infinilytics.com</a> or: (844) 826-6906 to schedule a demonstration of Charlee™. </p>\r\n            <hr />\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">\r\n                <sup>[1]</sup>\r\n                </a> Insights engine defined: <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3961025/magic-quadrant-for-insight-engines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3961025/magic-quadrant-for-insight-engines</a>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                <a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\">\r\n                <sup>[2]</sup>\r\n                </a> An ontology for artificial intelligence specific for insurance is the knowledge base (business expert) combined with models and unique knowledge representation that powers machine learning algorithms and the search engine.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">\r\n                <sup>[1]</sup>\r\n                </a> The word insight describes a deep understanding of a person or thing.

    "content": "Workflow Automation, Litigation Prediction, Fraud Recognition with Charlee™\n \nFive Minutes with the Infinilytics’ Innovation TeamThe last several months have caused the insurance industry to change in so many ways. Some insurance companies are reporting a decline in revenue while others are maintaining or have increased.  The pandemic, hurricanes, and wildfires cause turmoil in the claims systems with backlogs, delayed payment processing, lack of claims resources, and perennial charlatans and fraudsters. They always emerge in these catastrophes preying on victims and insurance carriers.\nLeverage Artificial Intelligence in Your Remote Work Force\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has forced claims and policy teams to adapt and leverage digital technology at an accelerated speed.  The remote workforce ecosystem The remote workforce accelerated the insurance industry to quickly adapt and start using digital technologies on a broader scale.  People have adapted to conducting business with these technologies (think of Zoom, Slack, Skype, etc.); however, how can claims and underwriting executives ensure that their workflow process is efficient and effective in the new remote work environment? How can you reduce bottlenecks in the process and identify valuable and critical insights into the claims process?\nIntroducing Charlee™ - The First Insurance A.I. Insights Engine\nInfinilytics has built the first insurance insights engine[1] for the insurance industry. An insights engine is a powerful tool to extract insights from a variety of structured and unstructured data. The Charlee™ Search insights engine was trained on over 35 million claims and has 40,000 + insights ready to go when deployed. The Infinilytics Team has created and built the required ontology[2] for the insurance claims process.  There is also a powerful semantic search capability for words and phrases utilized in categorizing the types of loss, causes of loss, and the unique characteristics of each kind of claim in each line of business.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] Insights engine defined: https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3961025/magic-quadrant-for-insight-engines[2] An ontology for artificial intelligence specific for insurance is the knowledge base (business expert) combined with models and unique knowledge representation that powers machine learning algorithms and the search engine.  Automation for the Claims Process\nCharlee provides fraud and litigation predictions in the form of flags and a score. The claims are scored (0-100) at the first notice of loss and vary based on the severity and number of flags. The score refreshes every time the claim receives new information such as a document, recorded statements, and third-party party reports. Based on the score, you can assign specific ones to senior or specialist adjusters for fair resolutions and cost-efficient process.\nBenefits of A.I. in the Automated Claims Process\nImagine being able to reduce costs and save money on needlessly processing claims while still providing superior customer service. Advanced A.I. can start to automate the claims process, thereby freeing up time for your Examiners and Claims Specialists to focus their time on more severe claims which might, or will, end up in litigation. The Infinilytics’ Charlee A.I. Suite provides recommendations (based on industry best practices), fraud alerts, high severity pattern analysis, and litigation prediction.  Charlee™ also acts as a cyber-supervisor that monitors your pending claims and how your Examiners are adjudicating the claims. Charlee™ will identify the most severe and potentially high-cost claims and bring them forward, so you improve the processing more efficiently, effectively, and timely. These efficiencies can also have a favorable impact on reducing outside investigative vendor and independent adjuster expenses, thereby decreasing Allocated and Unallocated Adjustment Expense.\nMoving Forward\nDigital technology platforms, like Charlee™, will not replace the human claims examine or agent, but it will significantly assist them in their jobs.  Charlee™ delivers round the clock insights on current claims for litigation, fraud identification, catastrophic incidents, and government compliance deadlines (think of government regulations and specific data calls).  Simplicity, efficiency, personalized service, and low cost is what customers expect from an insurance company. Charlee™ helps you meet these expectations.\n\nInfinilytics has innovated in artificial intelligence and machine learning with Charlee™.  Your customer experience and success stories will highlight your team’s ability to adopt advanced technologies in our ever-changing world quickly.\n\nContact us at info@infinilytics.com or: (844) 826-6906 to schedule a demonstration of Charlee™.",

Our personal lives and businesses have changed in so many ways: some bad, but some good. The year of disruption, indeed. All of us have now experienced a pandemic and how instantly it has affected our lives.  In the midst of this, successful companies with excellent leadership and entrepreneurial spirit have pivoted and thrived in their respective marketplace.\n                    \n                    \n                    The pandemic has caused everyone to alter and adopt new routines quickly.  Change is good, and in times of uncertainty, leaders emerge with new ideas and concepts to solve problems that might seem unsolvable.  The insurance industry had to quickly embrace the new remote workforce that made all of us quickly learn the nuances of video conferences with team and client meetings (and we needed to learn how to use all of them).  The daily activities of your claims examiners and agents may appear to be running efficiently, but how are you ensuring that every one of your resources is successful?  How are you ensuring that critical deadlines (i.e., demand letters, litigation deadlines, government compliance, reporting, etc.) are achieved? A ‘cyber claims assistant’ may be the immediate answer for these issues.\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    Team camaraderie in a virtual environment can be a challenge. Investigations still need to be completed effectively and efficiently.  Your team is working remotely, and probably more from their desk (or improvised home office workspace).  So how are you ensuring that the team is communicating and working efficiently? Leveraging the right technology platforms for your teams, supervisors, managers, and the C-Suite is a critical building block to ensure the best communication and coordination in productivity.  Consider this - - A robust artificial intelligence platform that is a type of ‘cyber supervisor,’ best practice recommendations, red flags, quality control alerts, and predict if a claim will fall into litigation working seamlessly alongside your claims management system. Introducing Charlee™ for aggregate and individual claim insights.\n                    \n                    \n                    Our Charlee™ platform allows supervisors and managers to monitor the claims process focusing on the reduction of allocated loss adjustment expenses and litigation costs.  State Department of Insurance regulations mandate the adherence of deadlines in the claims process.  If a legal demand letter or a statute due date is ignored, the cost of your claim can grow exponentially.  The Charlee™ solution will remind your claims team of deadlines and closely monitor and analyze the data required for your team member to make the right decision.

Our personal lives and businesses have changed in so many ways: some bad, but some good. The year of disruption, indeed. All of us have now experienced a pandemic and how instantly it has affected our lives.&nbsp; In the midst of this, successful companies with excellent leadership and entrepreneurial spirit have pivoted and thrived in their respective marketplace.</p>\r\n            <p  className=\"mt-4\">The pandemic has caused everyone to alter and adopt new routines quickly.&nbsp; Change is good, and in times of uncertainty, leaders emerge with new ideas and concepts to solve problems that might seem unsolvable.&nbsp; The insurance industry had to quickly embrace the new remote workforce that made all of us quickly learn the nuances of video conferences with team and client meetings (and we needed to learn how to use all of them).&nbsp; The daily activities of your claims examiners and agents may appear to be running efficiently, but how are you ensuring that every one of your resources is successful?&nbsp; How are you ensuring that critical deadlines (i.e., demand letters, litigation deadlines, government compliance, reporting, etc.) are achieved? A ‘cyber claims assistant’ may be the immediate answer for these issues.</p>\r\n            <div className=\"mt-4 w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url('/blog-photos/2020-3.jpg')`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center' }}> </div>\r\n            \r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Team camaraderie in a virtual environment can be a challenge. Investigations still need to be completed effectively and efficiently.&nbsp; Your team is working remotely, and probably more from their desk (or improvised home office workspace).&nbsp; So how are you ensuring that the team is communicating and working efficiently? Leveraging the right technology platforms for your teams, supervisors, managers, and the C-Suite is a critical building block to ensure the best communication and coordination in productivity.&nbsp; Consider this – – A robust artificial intelligence platform that is a type of ‘cyber supervisor,’ best practice recommendations, red flags, quality control alerts, and predict if a claim will fall into litigation working seamlessly alongside your claims management system. Introducing Charlee™ for aggregate and individual claim insights.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Our Charlee™ platform allows supervisors and managers to monitor the claims process focusing on the reduction of allocated loss adjustment expenses and litigation costs.&nbsp; State Department of Insurance regulations mandate the adherence of deadlines in the claims process.&nbsp; If a legal demand letter or a statute due date is ignored, the cost of your claim can grow exponentially.&nbsp; The Charlee™ solution will remind your claims team of deadlines and closely monitor and analyze the data required for your team member to make the right decision.

    "content": "\n\nThe Infinilytics Team and Charlee™, the first Insurance Insights Engine, have been very busy this year working with several insurance companies on commercial general liability claims and risk management issues. Our Innovation Team has noted several consistent problems in processing and negotiating slip-and-fall claims and wanted to share some thought leadership considerations for claim examiners, managers, and executives.\n\nThe most common type of claim in commercial general liability insurance is the slip-and-fall. Of course, accidents happen, but the adage in risk management, “If it’s predictable, it’s preventable,” must be followed by the business owner and the insurance carrier writing the policy for indemnity coverage. Loss prevention recommendations by Risk Management must be taken seriously by your customers to reduce the frequency, severity, and litigation related to slip-and-fall and trip-and-fall claims. Here are some quick facts on the common types of injuries sustained in these claims :\n\n• More than one million people go to the emergency room every year for a slip and fall accident, which equals 2,000 people a day in the United States alone.\n\n• Slip and fall claims cost general liability insurers an average of $30,000 per settlement.\n\n• Commercial insurer CNA reported that between 2007 and 2012, the average cost of a traumatic brain injury in a liability claim was $269,643.00\n\nMore statistics :\n\n• According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average hospital cost of a slip and fall is more than $30,000.00\n\n• High-end commercial properties are a particular risk because of the focus on heritage properties, original design materials, and glossy floor finishes.\n\nRisk management strategies are usually in place to prevent falls, but accidents do happen. The right A.I. solution for your claims and underwriting team is the first step in crafting a severity and litigation strategy.\n\n\n\nCharlatans Versus Legitimate Claims with Serious Injuries\n\n\n\nPeople who intentionally stage slipping and falling in a business (or somewhere on the property) are nothing new. We have seen countless newscast stories depicting people pouring liquids on the floor and then lying down feigning injuries. Many of these folks are caught by video camera surveillance. The astute employee follows their policies and protocols in reporting these incidents to the appropriate authorities and their insurance company. Unfortunately, however, some people try to get away with sophisticated insurance fraud schemes. One example is where attorneys systematically used homeless people and people suffering from substance abuse to stage slip-and-fall incidents, preying on businesses and their insurance carriers to the tune of $31 million before being caught.\n\nInsurance companies can mitigate this type of behavior with robust artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing in the underwriting and claims process, starting at the First Notice of Loss (FNOL). As a result, legitimate claims involving severe injuries can be distinguished from questionable ones, saving your company money.\n\n\n\nIntroducing Charlee™ - The First Insurance Insights Engine\n\n\nThe Infinilytics team is multidisciplinary with deep experience in insurance, technology, data science, and government; specifically, law enforcement (white-collar crime expertise) and legislative and regulatory best practices.  The combination of these fields led to the creation of the first-ever Insurance Insights Engine – Charlee™.  Charlee™ (patent pending) is an artificial intelligence solution with machine learning and natural language processing with over 40,000 prebuilt insights.  One powerful and unique feature of Charlee™ is that through unstructured text analysis, topics and patterns (behaviors) are identified, analyzed, and presented in an intuitive interface allowing the user to identify claims trending towards possible high severity and litigation quickly. In addition, the Charlee™ solution is a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) that can easily integrate via an automated program interface (API) into your claims and underwriting process. Infinilytics’ customers start with a proof-of-concept project for up to six weeks with their claims and underwriting data. Upon completion and acceptance, the customer can immediately begin using Charlee™ while additional and custom requirements are created and deployed.  In short, you can have an A.I. solution up and running within a few weeks, not one to two years. \n<1> Gordon Graham, Lexipol, https://www.lexipol.com\n\n<2> Risk & Insurance (May 2018, p. 32)\n\n<3>  https://safetydirectamerica.com/whats-the-cost-of-a-slip-and-fall-on-a-commercial-property/\n\n\n\nLeverage Charlee™ at the First Notice of Loss to Mitigate Severity and Litigation!\n\n\n\nPeople who intentionally stage slipping and falling in a business (or somewhere on the property) are nothing new.

As a result, legitimate claims involving severe injuries can be distinguished from questionable ones, saving your company money.\n\n\n\nUse Case\n\n\n\nThe Infinilytics client needed better insights on their fast-food restaurants’ policyholders as claim frequency and severity were high. Charlee™ quickly analyzed past claims for topics and events that lead to increased severity and litigation. With Charlee™ examining thousands of claim notes (unstructured text), many issues and entities were identified in the designated high severity claims. Additionally, the cause of the loss, combined with the reported injuries and the subsequent medical treatments with healthcare professionals, exposed potential areas where the Claims Examiner and Manager can take the appropriate action steps to reduce the severity and save costs.\n\nCharlee™ does not stop analyzing data at the FNOL. Instead, Charlee™ constantly analyzes prior claims, incident reports, witness statements, emergency medical service reports, hospital reports, and any documentation regarding the insured property’s maintenance. Charlee™ will point out red flags for suspicious behavior patterns and make quality control alerts (industry best practices) for the Claim Examiner to review and consider while investigating the claim.\n\nAs the claim progresses, insights are identified for high severity, best practices, and pre-litigation patterns. Charlee™ learns from the past, leverages the insights into current claims, and monitors the actions of the Claims Examiner to understand further, which brings more insights into the process. In other words, Charlee™ is the ultimate ‘cyber-supervisor’ and assistant for the claims team! The benefit of Charlee™ is that you will meet your customer’s needs and lower claims costs, improve the efficiency of the claim investigation, and reduce the severity.\n\nGetting Started\n\nCall us today to speak with a representative and learn how Charlee™ can help you. In a few weeks, you can have the first Insurance Insights Engine deployed for your claims and underwriting team and quickly realize cost savings in your allocated loss adjustment expenses, indemnity, and litigation.\n\n<4> https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/two-ny-lawyers-accused-31-mln-insurance-scam-2021-08-2\n\n",

Here are some quick facts on the common types of injuries sustained in these claims :</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">• More than one million people go to the emergency room every year for a slip and fall accident, which equals 2,000 people a day in the United States alone.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">• Slip and fall claims cost general liability insurers an average of $30,000 per settlement.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">• Commercial insurer CNA reported that between 2007 and 2012, the average cost of a traumatic brain injury in a liability claim was $269,643.00</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">More statistics :</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">• According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average hospital cost of a slip and fall is more than $30,000.00</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">• High-end commercial properties are a particular risk because of the focus on heritage properties, original design materials, and glossy floor finishes.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Risk management strategies are usually in place to prevent falls, but accidents do happen. The right A.I. solution for your claims and underwriting team is the first step in crafting a severity and litigation strategy.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"mt-8 w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(https://charlee.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Managing-Slip-and-Fall-Claims-Severity-with-Artificial-Intelligence-v2.jpg)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center' }}></div>\r\n            <h3 class=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Charlatans Versus Legitimate Claims with Serious Injuries</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">People who intentionally stage slipping and falling in a business (or somewhere on the property) are nothing new. We have seen countless newscast stories depicting people pouring liquids on the floor and then lying down feigning injuries. Many of these folks are caught by video camera surveillance. The astute employee follows their policies and protocols in reporting these incidents to the appropriate authorities and their insurance company. Unfortunately, however, some people try to get away with sophisticated insurance fraud schemes. One example is where attorneys systematically used homeless people and people suffering from substance abuse to stage slip-and-fall incidents, preying on businesses and their insurance carriers to the tune of $31 million before being caught.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Insurance companies can mitigate this type of behavior with robust artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing in the underwriting and claims process, starting at the First Notice of Loss (FNOL). As a result, legitimate claims involving severe injuries can be distinguished from questionable ones, saving your company money.</p>\r\n            <h3 class=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\" >Introducing Charlee™ – The First Insurance Insights Engine</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                <span >The Infinilytics team is multidisciplinary with deep experience in insurance, technology, data science, and government; specifically, law enforcement (white-collar crime expertise) and legislative and regulatory best practices.&nbsp; The combination of these fields led to the creation of the first-ever Insurance Insights Engine – Charlee™.&nbsp; Charlee™ (patent pending) is an artificial intelligence solution with machine learning and natural language processing with over 40,000 prebuilt insights.&nbsp; One powerful and unique feature of Charlee™ is that through unstructured text analysis, topics and patterns (behaviors) are identified, analyzed, and presented in an intuitive interface allowing the user to identify claims trending towards possible high severity and litigation quickly. In addition, the Charlee™ solution is a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) that can easily integrate via an automated program interface (API) into your claims and underwriting process. Infinilytics’ customers start with a proof-of-concept project for up to six weeks with their claims and underwriting data. Upon completion and acceptance, the customer can immediately begin using Charlee™ while additional and custom requirements are created and deployed.&nbsp; In short, you can have an A.I. solution up and running within a few weeks, not one to two years.&nbsp;</span>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                [1] Gordon Graham, Lexipol, <a href=\"https://www.lexipol.com/\">https://www.lexipol.com</a>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">[2] Risk &amp; Insurance (May 2018, p. 32)</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">[3] &nbsp;https://safetydirectamerica.com/whats-the-cost-of-a-slip-and-fall-on-a-commercial-property/</p>\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"mt-8 w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(https://charlee.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Managing-Slip-and-Fall-Claims-Severity-with-Artificial-Intelligence.jpg)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center' }}></div>\r\n            <h3 class=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\" >Leverage Charlee™ at the First Notice of Loss to Mitigate Severity and Litigation!</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">People who intentionally stage slipping and falling in a business (or somewhere on the property) are nothing new. We have seen countless newscast stories depicting people pouring liquids on the floor and then lying down feigning injuries. Many of these folks are caught by video camera surveillance. The astute employee follows their policies and protocols in reporting these incidents to the appropriate authorities and their insurance company. Unfortunately, however, some people try to get away with sophisticated insurance fraud schemes.

Charlee™ quickly analyzed past claims for topics and events that lead to increased severity and litigation. With Charlee™ examining thousands of claim notes (unstructured text), many issues and entities were identified in the designated high severity claims. Additionally, the cause of the loss, combined with the reported injuries and the subsequent medical treatments with healthcare professionals, exposed potential areas where the Claims Examiner and Manager can take the appropriate action steps to reduce the severity and save costs.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Charlee™ does not stop analyzing data at the FNOL. Instead, Charlee™ constantly analyzes prior claims, incident reports, witness statements, emergency medical service reports, hospital reports, and any documentation regarding the insured property’s maintenance. Charlee™ will point out red flags for suspicious behavior patterns and make quality control alerts (industry best practices) for the Claim Examiner to review and consider while investigating the claim.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">As the claim progresses, insights are identified for high severity, best practices, and pre-litigation patterns. Charlee™ learns from the past, leverages the insights into current claims, and monitors the actions of the Claims Examiner to understand further, which brings more insights into the process. In other words, Charlee™ is the ultimate ‘cyber-supervisor’ and assistant for the claims team! The benefit of Charlee™ is that you will meet your customer’s needs and lower claims costs, improve the efficiency of the claim investigation, and reduce the severity.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">\r\n            <strong>Getting Started</strong>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Call us today to speak with a representative and learn how Charlee™ can help you. In a few weeks, you can have the first Insurance Insights Engine deployed for your claims and underwriting team and quickly realize cost savings in your allocated loss adjustment expenses, indemnity, and litigation.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                [4] <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/two-ny-lawyers-accused-31-mln-insurance-scam-2021-08-25/\">https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/two-ny-lawyers-accused-31-mln-insurance-scam-2021-08-2</a>\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>"

Therefore, the two most critical tasks a Claim Manager must accomplish every day are monitoring high-priority claims and responding to compliance and regulatory issues. In addition, the Claims Manager must make informed decisions impacting these key performance indicators: SeverityLitigation Potential FraudOne can group Compliance and Regulatory Tasks as follows:Mandated ReportingData CallsInternal ReportingFair Claims Practices RegulationsAnti-Fraud ComplianceWhat do all of these have in common? Data!  Managers need lots of data to gather, organize, synthesize, and act upon, and often compounded with time demands for a response.  Your time is precious and a dwindling resource!  \n\n\n\nHow Artificial Intelligence Can Help\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence is ubiquitous in our daily lives. Smartwatch? Smartphone? Google? Amazon? FaceBook? LinkedIn? YouTube? Instagram? You get the idea! These platforms run on sophisticated algorithms, which data scientists constantly monitor for insights to advertise, acquire customers, and improve customer engagement. Artificial intelligence is still in its infancy stages, but with the advancements in data science and natural language processing (NLP), some remarkable things are happening in InsureTech.\n\n\n\nEmbrace InsureTech\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence is a force multiplier for time management and critical decision-making in the business of insurance.  Imagine being able to quickly learn about priority claims identified as likely high risk with severe damages. Then, you could take immediate steps to mitigate the severity and thereby reduce expenses. For example, what could you do if A.I. predicted the likelihood that a claim would end up litigated several weeks before an attorney is involved in the lawsuit? Imagine the cost and expense savings by avoiding costly legal proceedings with possible unfavorable verdicts. Insurance executives can be more agile, responsive, and successful with an A.I. solution with NLP guiding with the right insights.A multi-disciplinary team at Infinilytics’ created Charlee™ Insights and a predictive analytics engine that reveals the most meaningful operational data insights with 80% accuracy. Charlee NLP was pre-trained by domain experts’ domain knowledge which adds to the accuracy and faster production implementationThe key to leveraging A.I. is it must provide the following value propositions:Start with a goal/objective - reduce litigation by X percent or reduce loss expenses by one percentStart with small wins and test thoroughly - Preferably, start with a task that’s repetitive, mundane, time-consuming, error-prone, and dealing with large volumes/varieties of dataBe ready to change your business process based on A.I. insightsIn the next couple of thought leadership blogs, we will explore and define specific use cases for multiple lines of business for claims and underwriting.  Stay tuned!\n\n",

    "content": "\n\nCommercial automobile insurance plays a vital role in our economy and is critical to the supply chain infrastructure. Think of the different types of commercial vehicles on our highways: delivery vehicles, utility trucks, box trucks, cargo vans, cement mixers, limousines, passenger buses, pickup trucks, and ubiquitous construction vehicles are critical to our supply chain infrastructure. In addition, the \"big rigs\" (tractor and semi-trailers) operate on our highways around the clock every day of the week in all types of weather conditions and on all kinds of roadways.\n\n\n\nCharlee.ai™ Improves Risk Selection, Lowers Claim Severity, and Mitigates Litigation for Insurance Claims\n\n\n\nTraffic collisions involving commercial vehicles can be costly and have risen in the last few years. On average, there are 500,000 commercial vehicle accidents every year, with one death or seriously injured party in an accident every 15 minutes. Consider the factors related to commercial vehicles (truck tractor and semi-trailer configuration) and their unique risks:\n\nThe total weight allowed for commercial vehicles:\nSingle axle: 20,000 poundsTandem axle: 34,000 poundsGross Vehicle Weight: 80,000 poundsThe average weight of a passenger vehicle: 4,156 pounds.In accidents involving one commercial vehicle and one passenger vehicle, 56 percent of passenger cars and 44 percent of trucks were responsible for the crash (Large Truck Crash Causation Study)\n\n\nCompared to a typical passenger vehicle involved in a collision, the commercial vehicles' sheer size and weight will result in severe damage and injuries. Identifying risks and exposures with artificial intelligence will lead to lower severity and avoid litigation.\n\n\n\nLitigation and Severity\n\n\n\nThe average cost of a commercial vehicle accident where one person was injured is $148,279, and a fatality is $7.2 million. These numbers quickly rise in an insurance claim with multiple persons and injuries.\n\nA recent Advisen article points out that in 2019, claims involving an attorney cost 14 times more on average than a claim without attorney involvement. These claims represented less than 30 percent of all commercial automobile claims; however, they accounted for 86.7% of total losses and loss adjustment expenses. Insurers need to gain control of these spiking costs by leveraging better insights into the claims and underwriting process. In 2019, claims costing more than $500,000 involving an attorney took 1,272 days to close on average. And the time trusted axiom in insurance, \"The longer the claim is open, the more expensive it will be,\" has never been more accurate.\n\nThe InsureTech race brings new ideas and technologies to the insurance industry at a lightning pace. The advances in artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning and natural language processing, can quickly lead to insights to mitigate and control high severity claims. In addition, there is now the ability to predict if a claim will fall into litigation weeks before an attorney is involved.\n\n\n\nCharlee.ai™ – The First Insurance Insights Engine with Natural Language Processing\n\n\n\nYour claims data system contains millions and millions of patterns to identify severity, litigation, and fraud to be proactive in reducing costs. The unstructured text within claim files includes the most insights for topics, entities, and behavior patterns leading to high severity and litigation.

Think of the different types of commercial vehicles on our highways: delivery vehicles, utility trucks, box trucks, cargo vans, cement mixers, limousines, passenger buses, pickup trucks, and ubiquitous construction vehicles are critical to our supply chain infrastructure. In addition, the “big rigs” (tractor and semi-trailers) operate on our highways around the clock every day of the week in all types of weather conditions and on all kinds of roadways.</p>\r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Charlee.ai™ Improves Risk Selection, Lowers Claim Severity, and Mitigates Litigation for Insurance Claims</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Traffic collisions involving commercial vehicles can be costly and have risen in the last few years. On average, there are 500,000 commercial vehicle accidents every year, with one death or seriously injured party in an accident every 15 minutes. Consider the factors related to commercial vehicles (truck tractor and semi-trailer configuration) and their unique risks:</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">The total weight allowed for commercial vehicles:</p>\r\n            <ul className=\"list-disc list-outside pl-4 mt-4\">\r\n                <li>Single axle: 20,000 pounds</li>\r\n                <li>Tandem axle: 34,000 pounds</li>\r\n                <li>Gross Vehicle Weight: 80,000 pounds</li>\r\n                <li>The average weight of a passenger vehicle: 4,156 pounds.</li>\r\n                <li>In accidents involving one commercial vehicle and one passenger vehicle, 56 percent of passenger cars and 44 percent of trucks were responsible for the crash ( <a href=\"https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/research-and-analysis/research/large-truck-crash-causation-study\">Large Truck Crash Causation Study</a>) </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"mt-8 w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/Commercial-Vehicle-Claims-1.jpg)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center' }}></div>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Compared to a typical passenger vehicle involved in a collision, the commercial vehicles’ sheer size and weight will result in severe damage and injuries. Identifying risks and exposures with artificial intelligence will lead to lower severity and avoid litigation.</p>\r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Litigation and Severity</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">The <a href=\"https://hdfleet.com/cost-of-a-truck-accident-to-a-company/\">average cost</a> of a commercial vehicle accident where one person was injured is $148,279, and a fatality is $7.2 million. These numbers quickly rise in an insurance claim with multiple persons and injuries. </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">A recent <a href=\"https://www.advisen.com/tools/fpnproc/fpns/articles_new_1/P/421943386.html?rid=421943386&amp;list_id=1\">Advisen</a> article points out that in 2019, claims involving an attorney cost 14 times more on average than a claim without attorney involvement. These claims represented less than 30 percent of all commercial automobile claims; however, they accounted for 86.7% of total losses and loss adjustment expenses. Insurers need to gain control of these spiking costs by leveraging better insights into the claims and underwriting process. In 2019, claims costing more than $500,000 involving an attorney took 1,272 days to close on average. And the time trusted axiom in insurance, “The longer the claim is open, the more expensive it will be,” has never been more accurate. </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">The InsureTech race brings new ideas and technologies to the insurance industry at a lightning pace. The advances in artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning and natural language processing, can quickly lead to insights to mitigate and control high severity claims. In addition, there is now the ability to predict if a claim will fall into litigation weeks before an attorney is involved.</p>\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"mt-8 w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/Vehicle-Claims-with-Artificial-Intelligence.jpg)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center' }}></div>\r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Charlee.ai™ – The First Insurance Insights Engine with Natural Language Processing</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Your claims data system contains millions and millions of patterns to identify severity, litigation, and fraud to be proactive in reducing costs.

John shared how his domain experience from his vast career has resulted in Charlee's Artificial Intelligence. In this podcast with good questions and commentary from Ken Cox, John Standish was able to touch on all the aspects where Charlee.ai is able to help the insurance industry as a whole. John Standish talked a little bit about the development of Charlee.ai all the way up to the products like our Litigation Management Dashboard that we offer today.While the role of technology in claims and litigation management is getting critical and urgent, the advantage Charlee.ai has is its board of advisors, an eclectic mix of legal experts, data architects, law mavericks, and deep domain experts from government and practitioner areas. Charlee does not just provide consistent inputs in shaping the technology but helps make it sharper and better predictive. Enormous costs are thus saved for insurers in claims litigation, ensuring customer retention and leveraging patterns and data to predict positive outcomes for everyone concerned.Watch the whole podcast here:\n\n\n\nRequest a Demo:\n\n",

For example, data is the fulcrum for analyzing and processing claims where litigation is managed, and disputes and arbitrations are resolved. New technologies such as Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrated into the insurance process have streamlined the flow by making sense of raw data, shutting out the noise, and deriving quicker results. In addition, disruption and innovation in the insurance space have sped up the process of understanding the vast amount of available data, using it to sharpen methods and applications.\n\n\n\nWhat is Unstructured Data?\n\n\n\nData is a treasure trove of information and knowledge. However, much of that data is in a state of chaos. Research suggests that 80% of available data is found in an unstructured form and out of reach of businesses across industries that use traditional technologies. Sources such as notes, internal collaterals, claim notes, documents, third-party PDFs, and news articles in the insurance industry are either in a form or sequence that cannot be deciphered. However, this type of data is a virtual goldmine of the information under our eyes going untapped. Making sense of unstructured data helps pick up clues and knowledge that plugs in the gaps of a claim’s trajectory or litigation process, thereby allowing the proper intervention to solve them. With unstructured data, you’ll be able to carefully listen to what it tells you rather than presuming or guessing how the claims will move forward. You will be able to identify opportunities and pick up clues on when an adjudicator is needed and what the end settlement will be. Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are the new technologies that find context and meaning within unstructured data. They help turn unstructured data into comprehensible, meaningful, machine-readable data for AI platforms or big data analysis. As a result, AI enables quick decision-making intervention at the right time, allowing businesses to cut losses or make purposeful decisions.\n\n\n\nApplications of Unstructured Data in Insurance\n\n\n\nWith the insurance industry in a constant state of flux and increased adoption of ML & AI, unstructured data can be optimally leveraged in the following ways;\nLitigation Prediction with Actionable Insights - Knowing about pending and open claims predicted to go into litigation or having attorney involvement based on in-depth analyses of past entities, timelines, sentiments, locations, and topics, at the click of a button helps in early intervention and assessment. In addition, bringing in senior litigation members to manage escalations and mitigate at the right time reduces the severity of the claim.\n\nLegacy Data Sources – The optimal use of unstructured and hitherto unused data to gain unique insights into behavioral patterns helps derive learnings and apply them across various interventions.Understand Historical Trends and Emerging Risks - Claims constantly leak money when the risks associated aren’t differentiated based on severity. Mapping historical data-based pre-trained tags/topics with KPIs can help derive trends and patterns across timelines, entities, and locations while adding context and explanations to predictions.\n\n\nResearch shows that the accuracy of traditional machine learning predictions in litigation prediction is 55% in automobile lines and less than in other lines of business. This is due to the complexity of the claims where unstructured data carries many of the facts needed for the machine to learn and predict more accurately.\n\nThe Charlee.ai platform predicts litigation up to 90-120 days in advance with up to 80% accuracy starting at First Notice of Loss (FNOL). Our patented approach brings pre-built and pretrained insights derived from proprietary KPIs to prioritize open and high-risk claims. The accuracy of our platform exponentially increases by browsing through ‘Trained and Tagged Data’ from unstructured data and documents such as - claim notes, third-party PDFs, and news media articles. Traditional machine learning misses these insights, which is one of the reasons for the machine bias. Our patented approach to extracting, interpreting, and summarizing tags/topics and the ability to remove domain noise provide a holistic overview of the claims process and litigation management.\n\n\n\nREQUEST A DEMO:\n\n",

Identifying and removing domain noise and transforming such tags into actionable intelligence can only happen on our incisive platform.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Charlee’s patented semantic-based NLP is designed by insurance experts and leverages their decades of experience in insurance claims handling and government regulations. Their expertise significantly improves precision and recall. For example, Charlee’s litigation prediction achieves over 80% precision with over a 70% recall.</p>\r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Visit us at ITC in Las Vegas Sept 20th-22th</h2>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Request a Demo:</h2>\r\n            <form action=\"https://charlee.ai/unlocking-the-value-of-unstructured-data-through-charlees-natural-language-processing/\" method=\"post\" className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"firstname\" className=\"block\">First Name <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"text\" name=\"firstname\" id=\"firstname\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"First Name *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"lastname\" className=\"block\">Last Name <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"text\" name=\"lastname\" id=\"lastname\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"Last Name *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"phone_number\" className=\"block\">Phone Number</label>\r\n                        <input type=\"tel\" name=\"phone_number\" id=\"phone_number\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" placeholder=\"888-888-8888\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"email\" className=\"block\">Email <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" id=\"email\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"@email *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                    <p>What Products Are You Interested In?</p>\r\n                    <div className=\"flex flex-col\">\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"LITIGATION MANAGMENT DASHBOARD\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            LITIGATION MANAGMENT DASHBOARD\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"SEVERITY MANAGMENT DASHBOARD\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            SEVERITY MANAGMENT DASHBOARD\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"CLAIMS PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DASHBOARD\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            CLAIMS PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DASHBOARD\r\n                        </label>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"mt-4 text-right\">\r\n                    <button type=\"submit\" className=\"bg-teal-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded\">Submit</button>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </form>\r\n        </div>"

    "content": "This is PART 1 of a four-part series.\n\nTHE VALUE OF UNSTRUCTURED DATA\n\n\n\nData is the new gold critical to receiving and processing an insurance claim. As a result, InsureTech companies are constantly figuring out how data can be gathered faster, transformed, analyzed, and presented into meaningful insights. Built on charging pre-determined premiums against uncertain future occurrences, insurance trajectories and claims patterns are unpredictable and volatile with uncertain and high risk. Yet the industry is booming, with the global insurance market touching $6.3 trillion in 2019 and growing exponentially yearly. The larger the scale of the sector, the more volatility, which is reflected in the number of cases going into litigation, payouts, and reconciliation. Understanding how to plan and pre-empt the trajectory of its claims processes goes a long way in predicting the insurance industry’s growth. This is where the role of unstructured data is of critical leverage.\n\n\n\nTHE ROLE OF DATA\n\n\n\nBig data is one of the core critical areas of the InsureTech industry. Hitherto unexplored and vaguely defined, data refers to all the details about different insurance claims and underwriting processes, notes, voice recordings, PDFs, and more that build up continuously during the lifetime of a legal process. Data has had an almost fringe benefit in the insurance sector thus far, more to maintain a record of procedures and actions, carefully filed away for future use if any. However, data has exceptional value – a fact only now revealed with new-age technology platforms like Charlee™ – that can disrupt the traditional insurance business model.\n\nInnovations in any industry have thus far been introduced by way of technologically amplified processes and innovations in methodology. Exploring the previous ‘useless’ data has helped advance the business phenomenally in the insurance sector, giving us a tremendous advantage. The trick lies in analyzing this data using new technologies to make sense of it, obtain practical insights into customer needs to make better, targeted products for them, and help the business make purposeful decisions. While generic Machine Learning platforms have been doing their bit in such analysis, it is for the first time that unstructured data is used as a source of information, from which predictive analytical algorithms can glean relevant insights. This is throwing up even more profound insights that predict how a claim will proceed, where it will end, and what can be done to reduce spending and save time for insurers.\n\nAI and data analytics reduce the manual hours spent on repetitive tasks, which pool plenty of people to do predictable work. Instead, it is now possible to build upon data to gain practical, far-reaching insights that offer more targeted products and make claims processes more efficient and less error-prone.\n\n\n\nUNSTRUCTURED DATA INSIGHTS\n\n\n\nUnstructured data is the unexplored frontier in Natural Language Processing (NLP) based predictive analytics. It comprises claim notes, third-party data (e.g., ISO and NICB reports ), news articles, and audio and video files. This is new and unknown information that often remains untouched, which otherwise can change the course of legal processes. Such data can also reveal unexplored business areas, unnecessarily consuming money, prolonging conflict resolution, and causing businesses to suffer loss and mayhem.\n\nAs easy as such data is to access, why hasn’t much been done about it?\n\nUnstructured data is a treasure trove of information within our fingertips to use in whatever way we feel possible. Yet, there haven’t been many technological advancements to understand it until now. Most new technologies were mining data but using it ineffectively. Thus, although traditional machine learning had learned to mine it, extracting insights was insufficient to make any reliable and accurate predictive analysis.\n\n\n\nWHAT HAS CHANGED UNSTRUCTURED DATA ANALYSIS?\n\n\n\nPredictive analytics-based machine learning insights are revolutionizing the way such unstructured data is read, and insights derived. By understanding patterns of claims behavior using prediction and claims management models on multiple customers and millions of insurance claims, we are now able to deliver clear, critical insights of claims trajectories, attorney interventions needed, accurately predict patterns of behavior, and convert them into actionable intelligence to make high-level decision calls.\n\nUnutilized data thus becomes the most significant missing piece of the puzzle that allows a platform such as Charlee.ai to derive key operational claims insights and predict litigation, severity, and the claims trajectory.\n\nPARTS 1234Written by: Charmaine Kenita and John Standish\n\nREQUEST A DEMO:\n\n",

    "content": "This is PART 2 of a four-part series.\n\nUnstructured data is driving innovation across industries. After all, MIT reports that much of the current data – almost 90% - is unstructured. Yet, despite this, companies across the spectrum can’t take advantage of it and leverage it for their business for several practical and functional reasons.\n\n\n\nTHE BASICS OF UNSTRUCTURED DATA\n\n\n\nRaw data that cannot be molded or fit into a form – excel, video, audio, images - is unstructured. It doesn’t conform to a data model and, as such, has no identifiable structure, is haphazard, and cannot be read by a software program. Its lack of organization in a pre-defined manner makes it unreadable. This data can be anything, from reviews for products to stock market trends and social posts. From a larger perspective, much of the world’s data is unstructured. For example, the things we read daily on Facebook or Instagram, articles that don’t have a fixed form or shape, are all very relevant and vital but cannot be deciphered for lack of a digital program or software.\n\nTo elaborate, below are a few characteristics of unstructured data:\nIt is structureless or lacks the definition of a known structureUnorganized, free-flowing, not stored in neat rows or columns like a databaseThere is no format, sequence, or flowData does not follow semantic rulesBecause of the lack of structure, no known computer programs can make sense of it\nUnstructured data can be in any form or shape. The most common types are Videos, Reports, PPTs, Memos, Social posts, Websites, and Surveys.\n\nAccessing such information by companies can help in myriad ways.\nBuilding Use Cases and White PapersForeseeing product or service trajectory and intervening when necessary\n\nFor innovation and new learnings or product discoveryTo derive business intelligence and discover analytics applicationsIt can be scaled, maneuvered, and optimized to use in a variety of waysTraditional ways of accessing unstructured data that include document scans done using OCR software are labor intensive, time-consuming, and something that not many organizations have available time, nor can they afford it.In the new means of deriving insights from unstructured data, Machine Learning is the game-changer in allowing computers to read and make sense of it, with intelligent, semantic algorithms that can access valuable information. Moreover, it can work in both big and large businesses to access as much or as little as they want to make critical business decisions.\n\n\nCOMMONEST TYPES OF UNSTRUCTURED DATA\n\n\n\nLook around you, and you’ll find online and offline data scattered across your interactive spaces. They can include social data, contact centre data, YouTube videos and emailers, and more. So let’s examine them a little closer.\n\nContact Centre Data: Contact centres are the everyday places where unstructured data originates in the insurance business. These places receive calls about products and services, interact with people, store their information, and process it to give customers a great user experience. Voice recordings are the most important; they are transcribed and stored in a database for future use.\n\n\n\nSocial Media Data: Massive real-world unstructured data is found in social media, where large amounts of information go back and forth freely. Comments, review videos, and posts, are all data that help align user experiences, with companies using them all the time for advertisement targeting, product segmenting, and much more.\n\nEmail Data: Email narratives are not structured; there’s no format they are written in, no structure to maintain. Yet they contain valuable information to ensure customer engagement for marketing products and services. Customer engagement is always relevant for providing vital feedback to be worked upon or finding areas of improvement.\n\nReview Videos: One of the most popular videos on YouTube is a video review of products and services. The #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt hashtag had nearly 6 million hits on Tiktok. Opinions like this influence others and is another form of unstructured data that is insight-heavy but not constrained by structure and can be extracted to use in myriad ways.\n\n\n\nBUSINESS AREAS THAT BENEFIT FROM UNSTRUCTURED DATA\n\n\n\nMARKETING – Unstructured data can help marketing teams sharpen their KPIs. Marketing teams often have tons of legacy data they don’t know what to do with it. Market Research is a manual process involving transcribing. Translating over hours can use unstructured data APIs and programs to develop planned approaches, address negative feedback, and gauge positive and negative trends in products and categories.\n\n\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT – Customer support teams, can do very well with unstructured data, breaking down team siloes. Hence, they work together to derive insights from chat transcripts and product reviews, tailoring their approach towards interactions with their customers. This process helps improve the entire service delivery and makes the company more efficient.\n\nSOLVING CORE BUSINESS PROBLEMS – Unstructured data is the tool that can solve many manually-run business services that previously suffered from chaos and errors and were time intensive. For example, automotive firms can use unstructured data to assess vehicle reviews, identify key phrases and provide better recommendations for future customers. Similarly, banking firms can look at chat transcripts from banking forums to understand service gaps and customer challenges and address or sharpen core business products.\n\nIn the insurance industry, Charlee.ai continuously leverages unstructured data to derive deep service insights using the platform’s predictive analytics algorithm, with the ability to ascertain early intervention of claims and closure, assess product risk, unnecessary costs, attorney interventions, and more, converting behavioral patterns to actionable intelligence. As a result, Charlee.ai is changing how the traditional insurance industry is serviced and run, with many companies slowly making inroads into the space.\n\nPARTS 1234",

    "content": "This is PART 3 of a four-part series.Unstructured data, as we've seen, forms the bulk of data lying about unused with businesses and industries. Emails, texts, legal reports, voice recordings, the list of such data is humungous and untapped in many ways. Yet, this data can be the oil that keeps different components of businesses running and provides valuable undiscovered insights now.   In the insurance industry, unstructured and structured data influence everything, from rating and pricing to claims cycles, litigation management, severity management, and underwriting. Given the sheer volume of available data, the insurance industry has devised a 6-factor framework to determine the quality and value of the data analyzed. When complemented with NLP-based technologies, they provide insurers with an overall framework to use raw data and convert them into actionable insights.THE BIG DATA SIX FACTOR FRAMEWORK FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY1. VOLUME – The term 'big data' comprising both structured and unstructured can be vague and immeasurable since insurers differ in their storage and analytics capabilities. Thus, what may seem huge for a small local insurer, maybe a drop in the ocean for a multinational corporation. The volume of big data is decided by insurers when reviewing their data storage systems. For example, on-premise or cloud and the various kinds of data utilized. It can impact many things, such as the carriers processing power and security.2. VELOCITY – Large amounts of data need to be generated, collected, and processed quickly; this is where the speed is critical. Forbes suggests the production of 2.5 quintillion bytes of data a day, and insurers must have systems to aggregate such data volumes to ensure data analytics perform at the optimum.3. VARIETY – More than the quantity of big data, the type of information available for insurers to derive insights from is critical. While structured data like texts and numbers are easy to derive, with NLP-based AI engines such as Charlee.ai, there are more profound insights and patterns that predictive analytics can unlock. As a result, insurers can use unconventional information to design policies, detect fraud, and enhance the overall customer experience. What insurers thus get is a complete picture of every customer, their past behaviors, claims cycles, the behavior of individual claims, and so much more, all derived from continuous access to unstructured data. 4. VERACITY – Data doesn't lie, goes a famous saying. Therefore, big data is a treasure of information that instills confidence in decision-making. However, although vast amounts of data are available and information is massive, some data could be unreliable and therefore needs to be optimized for genuineness. Making the most accurate decisions with large data sets depends on the strength of the predictive analytics platform and is critical for insurers. 5. VALIDITY – Data out there may be massive, but its relevance to the desired outcomes is an important criterion. When collecting data for insurance, it is critical to match data sets to the desired results (analytics). Setting up patterns in doing this increases outcomes' accuracy from structured and unstructured data.6. VALUE – Perhaps the most critical factor of big data in insurance is value. Among the primary purposes of importance, these two are essential; one is whether the data collected is good or bad; two, the other is whether insurers can make well-informed, business-driven decisions with deep insights from all this data.

Emails, texts, legal reports, voice recordings, the list of such data is humungous and untapped in many ways. Yet, this data can be the oil that keeps different components of businesses running and provides valuable undiscovered insights now.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">In the insurance industry, unstructured and structured data influence everything, from rating and pricing to claims cycles, litigation management, severity management, and underwriting. Given the sheer volume of available data, the insurance industry has devised a 6-factor framework to determine the quality and value of the data analyzed. When complemented with NLP-based technologies, they provide insurers with an overall framework to use raw data and convert them into actionable insights.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">THE BIG DATA SIX FACTOR FRAMEWORK FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">1. <strong>VOLUME</strong> – The term ‘big data’ comprising both structured and unstructured can be vague and immeasurable since insurers differ in their storage and analytics capabilities. Thus, what may seem huge for a small local insurer, maybe a drop in the ocean for a multinational corporation. The volume of big data is decided by insurers when reviewing their data storage systems. For example, on-premise or cloud and the various kinds of data utilized. It can impact many things, such as the carriers processing power and security.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">2. <strong>VELOCITY</strong> – Large amounts of data need to be generated, collected, and processed quickly; this is where the speed is critical. Forbes suggests the production of 2.5 quintillion bytes of data a day, and insurers must have systems to aggregate such data volumes to ensure data analytics perform at the optimum.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">3. <strong>VARIETY</strong> – More than the quantity of big data, the type of information available for insurers to derive insights from is critical. While structured data like texts and numbers are easy to derive, with NLP-based AI engines such as Charlee.ai, there are more profound insights and patterns that predictive analytics can unlock. As a result, insurers can use unconventional information to design policies, detect fraud, and enhance the overall customer experience. What insurers thus get is a complete picture of every customer, their past behaviors, claims cycles, the behavior of individual claims, and so much more, all derived from continuous access to unstructured data.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/THE-SIX-V-S-OF-DATA-AND-THE-VALUE-FOR-INSURERS-image2.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">4. <strong>VERACITY</strong> – Data doesn’t lie, goes a famous saying. Therefore, big data is a treasure of information that instills confidence in decision-making. However, although vast amounts of data are available and information is massive, some data could be unreliable and therefore needs to be optimized for genuineness. Making the most accurate decisions with large data sets depends on the strength of the predictive analytics platform and is critical for insurers.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">5. <strong>VALIDITY</strong> – Data out there may be massive, but its relevance to the desired outcomes is an important criterion. When collecting data for insurance, it is critical to match data sets to the desired results (analytics). Setting up patterns in doing this increases outcomes’ accuracy from structured and unstructured data.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">6. <strong>VALUE</strong> – Perhaps the most critical factor of big data in insurance is value. Among the primary purposes of importance, these two are essential; one is whether the data collected is good or bad; two, the other is whether insurers can make well-informed, business-driven decisions with deep insights from all this data. Data – especially unstructured – is generated in large amounts and can get watered down in quality. Therefore, having a platform that can semantically pick up relevant data with good quality, is reliable and consistent helps insurers to continue making data-driven decisions rather than guesswork estimations. In addition, insurers must know what to do with such data, where to use it, and make pricing and risk selection decisions accordingly.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/THE-SIX-V-S-OF-DATA-AND-THE-VALUE-FOR-INSURERS-image3.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">LEVERAGING UNSTRUCTURED DATA IN INSURANCE</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Insurers can maximize the data they collect with the 6-V framework.

    "content": "This is PART 4 of a four-part series.Insurance companies for the most part have been sitting on mountains of unexplored data. They don’t know it exists, they don’t understand its value and because of this are missing out on insights right before their very eyes. This area in data management is also like a blind spot, throwing up only a partial picture of claims management, making insurance companies vulnerable and resulting in increased payouts, longer claims lifecycle, and delayed attorney intervention.Data today has unlimited possibilities in solving many gaps and challenges. Almost 90% of such unstructured data across industries is being currently studied to understand what all can be derived from it. This revolution is happening at an unprecedented scale.Given the impact of this, it is critical to understand some of the technology unraveling unstructured data, and its implications at a deeper level on the insurance business.When it comes to the insurance industry, the major impact of big data is being seen in the claims departments. From text mining to semantics, data analytics is reshaping the entire claims process and especially claims triaging, process efficiency, attorney intervention, and fraud detection.Unfortunately reading and understanding this unstructured data is only in the purview of a few technology-enabled businesses who can read, understand, map patterns and analyze them. When it comes to claims; police notes, claimants’ statements, witness accounts and adjuster notes need to be processed and cleaned out before any insights are derived from them, a process needing tailored technology engines while the data is put to actionable use.TEXT MINING AND SEMANTIC ANALYSISText mining is a relatively simple way of uncovering the hidden value in mountains of unstructured data. This process extracts useful information from unstructured text, scanning large amounts of data for phrases or keywords (like Google searches). But unlike the search engine, an artificial engine such as Charlee™ uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to go beyond simply finding information to analyzing and finding patterns and signatures in the media for critical facts, and relationships within that data.AI-based engines, therefore, have the enhanced capability of scanning reports across media, interpreting adjuster notes, and discovering sentiments of the involved parties – from their product opinion to feelings after filing a claim – all just by reading through tonnes of material.TEXT MINING AND SEMANTIC ANALYSISAmong insurance processes, the claims department has the most to benefit from technological intervention of text mining tools. Analyzing things such as claim filing call transcripts reveals several insights, helping better structure call center operations and picking up specific tones, keywords and references. Locating keywords that indicate potential for complicated claims, any move towards litigation can necessitate a close look, or get an experienced adjuster involved earlier in the process.Text mining of such claims also sharpens the processes of the insurance company, helping develop new products and plugging gaps in existing insurance coverage that may be negatively impacting customer retention and renewals. This mining also throws up interesting insights on demographics for claims sets, specific locations prone to certain risks and even the claim areas to intervene before escalation sets in.IDENTIFYING FRAUDIdentifying the fraud potential of claims sets using text mining is perhaps the biggest benefit for insurance companies. Big data techniques are able to identify claimants likely to commit fraud in the underwriting stage and claims phase. Red flags not spotted by claims adjusters manually can pull up interesting insights. For example, multiple people using the same language when filing claims can be pulled up as suspicious by an algorithm, otherwise missed if several people are handling the claims. Similar physicians, witnesses coming up across various unrelated claims are a fraud red flag which such technology can pick and identify.THE MERGING OF AI-ENGINES & CLAIMS PROCESSESThe creation of NLP-based algorithms to extract insights from data efficiently and present results in a meaningful, revelatory way gives insurers an edge in streamlining and optimizing so many of their business processes. This is a collaborative effort where subject matter experts (SMEs) join hands with data analytics engines and tools to make sense of everything. In Charlee™ for example, an expertise of the subject gives us the edge in extracting relevant data, create customized KPI models and present insurance insights that deep dive into the claims management process. It is for this reason that litigation prediction happens 90-120 days in advance using our predictive analytics engine with approximately 85% accuracy starting at FNOL.CONCLUSIONWhile data models and claims prediction engines are disrupting the way insurance industry processes function, it is deep subject matter expertise collaborating with data algorithms that can identify meaningful trends in text mining. Insurers and claims adjusters will have a critical advantage to triage and track complicated claims, make sense of unstructured data to be one step ahead of claimants, and continue refining processes to derive more purposeful value that can help the industry as a whole.PARTS 1234Written by: Charmaine Kenita and John Standish",

Similar physicians, witnesses coming up across various unrelated claims are a fraud red flag which such technology can pick and identify.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/SIMPLIFYING-THE-UNDERLYING-TECHNOLOGY-BEHIND-UNSTRUCTURED-DATA-ANALYSIS-image3.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">THE MERGING OF AI-ENGINES & CLAIMS PROCESSES</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">The creation of NLP-based algorithms to extract insights from data efficiently and present results in a meaningful, revelatory way gives insurers an edge in streamlining and optimizing so many of their business processes. This is a collaborative effort where subject matter experts (SMEs) join hands with data analytics engines and tools to make sense of everything. In Charlee™ for example, an expertise of the subject gives us the edge in extracting relevant data, create customized KPI models and present insurance insights that deep dive into the claims management process. It is for this reason that litigation prediction happens 90-120 days in advance using our predictive analytics engine with approximately 85% accuracy starting at FNOL.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/SIMPLIFYING-THE-UNDERLYING-TECHNOLOGY-BEHIND-UNSTRUCTURED-DATA-ANALYSIS-image4.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">CONCLUSION</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">While data models and claims prediction engines are disrupting the way insurance industry processes function, it is deep subject matter expertise collaborating with data algorithms that can identify meaningful trends in text mining. Insurers and claims adjusters will have a critical advantage to triage and track complicated claims, make sense of unstructured data to be one step ahead of claimants, and continue refining processes to derive more purposeful value that can help the industry as a whole.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><em>Written by Charmaine Kenita and John Standish</em></p>\r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-8 text-[22px] font-bold\">Request a Demo:</h2>\r\n            <form action=\"https://charlee.ai/part-4-simplifying-the-underlying-technology-behind-unstructured-data-analysis/\" method=\"post\" className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"firstname\" className=\"block\">First Name <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"text\" name=\"firstname\" id=\"firstname\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"First Name *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"lastname\" className=\"block\">Last Name <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"text\" name=\"lastname\" id=\"lastname\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"Last Name *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"phone_number\" className=\"block\">Phone Number</label>\r\n                        <input type=\"tel\" name=\"phone_number\" id=\"phone_number\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" placeholder=\"888-888-8888\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"email\" className=\"block\">Email <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" id=\"email\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"@email *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                    <p>I would like to:</p>\r\n                    <div className=\"flex flex-col\">\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Learn more about the Free POC *\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Learn more about the Free POC *\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Receive Product Information\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Receive Product Information\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Request a Demo\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Request a Demo\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Receive your Whitepaper\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Receive your Whitepaper\r\n                        </label>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"mt-4 text-right\">\r\n                    <button type=\"submit\" className=\"bg-teal-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded\">Submit</button>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </form>\r\n        </div>"

    "content": "For most insurance companies, the start of the new year mandates building a roadmap (strategic plan) exploring new technology that can solve problems or streamline their claims process and achieve financial goals in the coming year. It is an exciting time to be in the insurance industry in that there is a sense of urgency conveyed by executives about artificial intelligence (A.I.), machine learning (M.L.), and natural language processing (N.L.P.) When you assemble your strategic planning team, there are five things to consider where A.I. can significantly lead to successful outcomes.1. The rising severity of personal and commercial vehicle claims.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recently released its comprehensive report for 2019. The costs of motor vehicle accidents are rising and cost $340 billion. Approximately 36,500 people were killed, 4.5 million were injured, and 23 million vehicles were damaged.<1> During the Pandemic, the number of cars on our highways decreased, but the severity of accidents increased (mainly due to speed). In addition, supply chain issues complicated the repairs of vehicles, and healthcare costs increased.2. The rising number of claims litigated and runaway or nuclear verdicts.A study from the American Transportation Research Institute published on June 23, 2020, revealed a 1,000% increase in jury verdicts involving truck crashes. The average verdict award for a lawsuit above $1 million involving a truck in an accident increased from $2.3 million to $22.3 million over nine years.<2>  Three key trends were identified as the rise in costs:\nShifting jury attitudes on how companies need to take all precautions no matter how practical or the costIncreased attorney representationIncreasingly aggressive plaintiff’s bar tactics (analytics)3. Climate change and the rising severity of natural disaster claims.$100 billion yearly is the new norm in the property and casualty (P&C) industry for weather-related claims. In 2022, weather-related disaster claims exceeded $120 billion. The cost of earthquakes, dust storms, droughts, and hurricanes worldwide exceeded $270 billion.<3> 2023 is off to a quick start with flooding and mudslides in California due to heavy rains. Our changing weather patterns have caused turmoil in the P&C industry because the hurricanes are more severe; flooding has occurred in non-designated flood zones, extreme drought conditions in the Western United States, and the never-ending wildfire danger.4. The skills and knowledge gap in the claim profession.Insurance executives are starting to worry about the institutional knowledge in their claim teams as older workers retire.  The new and younger claim workforce may be temporary, as it is a struggle to recruit and retain people to enter the insurance profession for a career.  The Pandemic spawned the “Great Resignation.” The remote workforce is here to stay, but insurance executives must develop better ways to fill the gaps between the new claim examiner and the experienced veteran.5. The multi-line claim.Since people have started working from home, workers’ compensation carriers are now dealing with a new scenario of work-related injuries. What happens if your employee trips or slips on a staircase in their home while walking into their workspace?  How will you handle the complex commercial vehicle claim that also involves a workers’ compensation or disability claim? Do not forget the cyber security breaches, mainly if your worker utilizes unsecured networks in public places or at home.Incorporate Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in Your 2023 RoadmapThe Rule of Three is a simple and concise guide for preparing the 2023 Roadmap.State the Problem.Explore the Possibilities.Execute.Machine learning with N.L.P. can quickly help you bridge the institutional knowledge gap and reduce and control claim severity.  Predictive analytics can reveal insights into your claims allowing the claim examiner to control the severity and provide positive outcomes for your insured and third-party clients.

It is an exciting time to be in the insurance industry in that there is a sense of urgency conveyed by executives about artificial intelligence (A.I.), machine learning (M.L.), and natural language processing (N.L.P.) When you assemble your strategic planning team, there are five things to consider where A.I. can significantly lead to successful outcomes.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">1. The rising severity of personal and commercial vehicle claims.</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recently released its comprehensive report for 2019. The costs of motor vehicle accidents are rising and cost $340 billion. Approximately 36,500 people were killed, 4.5 million were injured, and 23 million vehicles were damaged. <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-releases-2019-crash-fatality-data\">[1]</a> During the Pandemic, the number of cars on our highways decreased, but the severity of accidents increased (mainly due to speed). In addition, supply chain issues complicated the repairs of vehicles, and healthcare costs increased.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">2. The rising number of claims litigated and runaway or nuclear verdicts.</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">A study from the American Transportation Research Institute published on June 23, 2020, revealed a 1,000% increase in jury verdicts involving truck crashes. The average verdict award for a lawsuit above $1 million involving a truck in an accident increased from $2.3 million to $22.3 million over nine years. <a href=\"https://www.constitutionstateservices.com/resources/trends-driving-escalating-jury-verdicts\">[2]</a> Three key trends were identified as the rise in costs:</p>\r\n            <ul className=\"mt-4 list-disc list-inside\">\r\n                <li>Shifting jury attitudes on how companies need to take all precautions no matter how practical or the cost</li>\r\n                <li>Increased attorney representation</li>\r\n                <li>Increasingly aggressive plaintiff’s bar tactics (analytics)</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/Building-the-2023-InsureTech-Roadmap-Five-Things-to-Consider-in-Claims-image2.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'contain', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">3. Climate change and the rising severity of natural disaster claims.</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">$100 billion yearly is the new norm in the property and casualty (P&amp;C) industry for weather-related claims. In 2022, weather-related disaster claims exceeded $120 billion. The cost of earthquakes, dust storms, droughts, and hurricanes worldwide exceeded $270 billion. <a href=\"https://www.claimsjournal.com/news/national/2023/01/10/314663.htm\">[3]</a> 2023 is off to a quick start with flooding and mudslides in California due to heavy rains. Our changing weather patterns have caused turmoil in the P&amp;C industry because the hurricanes are more severe; flooding has occurred in non-designated flood zones, extreme drought conditions in the Western United States, and the never-ending wildfire danger.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">4. The skills and knowledge gap in the claim profession.</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Insurance executives are starting to worry about the institutional knowledge in their claim teams as older workers retire. The new and younger claim workforce may be temporary, as it is a struggle to recruit and retain people to enter the insurance profession for a career. The Pandemic spawned the “Great Resignation.” The remote workforce is here to stay, but insurance executives must develop better ways to fill the gaps between the new claim examiner and the experienced veteran.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">5. The multi-line claim.</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Since people have started working from home, workers’ compensation carriers are now dealing with a new scenario of work-related injuries. What happens if your employee trips or slips on a staircase in their home while walking into their workspace? How will you handle the complex commercial vehicle claim that also involves a workers’ compensation or disability claim? Do not forget the cyber security breaches, mainly if your worker utilizes unsecured networks in public places or at home.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/Building-the-2023-InsureTech-Roadmap-Five-Things-to-Consider-in-Claims-image3.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Incorporate Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in Your 2023 Roadmap</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">The Rule of Three is a simple and concise guide for preparing the 2023 Roadmap.</p>\r\n            <ol className=\"mt-4 list-decimal list-inside\">\r\n                <li>State the Problem.</li>\r\n                <li>Explore the Possibilities.</li>\r\n                <li>Execute.</li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Machine learning with N.L.P. can quickly help you bridge the institutional knowledge gap and reduce and control claim severity. Predictive analytics can reveal insights into your claims allowing the claim examiner to control the severity and provide positive outcomes for your insured and third-party clients. For example, imagine receiving alerts that a claim will likely fall into litigation before an attorney is involved and files a lawsuit. These outcomes driven by artificial intelligence can quickly be realized with a proper Roadmap.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/Building-the-2023-InsureTech-Roadmap-Five-Things-to-Consider-in-Claims-image4.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">References</h2>\r\n            <ol className=\"mt-4 list-decimal list-inside\">\r\n                <li><a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-releases-2019-crash-fatality-data\">https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-releases-2019-crash-fatality-data</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href=\"https://www.constitutionstateservices.com/resources/trends-driving-escalating-jury-verdicts\">https://www.constitutionstateservices.com/resources/trends-driving-escalating-jury-verdicts</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href=\"https://www.claimsjournal.com/news/national/2023/01/10/314663.htm\">https://www.claimsjournal.com/news/national/2023/01/10/314663.htm</a></li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-8 text-[22px] font-bold\">Request a Demo:</h2>\r\n            <form action=\"https://charlee.ai/building-the-2023-insuretech-roadmap-five-things-to-consider-in-claims/\" method=\"post\" className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"firstname\" className=\"block\">First Name <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"text\" name=\"firstname\" id=\"firstname\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"First Name *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"lastname\" className=\"block\">Last Name <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"text\" name=\"lastname\" id=\"lastname\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"Last Name *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"phone_number\" className=\"block\">Phone Number</label>\r\n                        <input type=\"tel\" name=\"phone_number\" id=\"phone_number\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" placeholder=\"888-888-8888\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"email\" className=\"block\">Email <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" id=\"email\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"@email *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                    <p>I would like to:</p>\r\n                    <div className=\"flex flex-col\">\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Learn more about the Free POC *\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Learn more about the Free POC *\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Receive Product Information\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Receive Product Information\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Request a Demo\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Request a Demo\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Receive your Whitepaper\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Receive your Whitepaper\r\n                        </label>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"mt-4 text-right\">\r\n                    <button type=\"submit\" className=\"bg-teal-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded\">Submit</button>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </form>\r\n        </div>"

    "content": "PART 2 of a Three part series.In the last article on understanding the role of sentiment analysis in data analytics, we discussed how Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based Sentiment Analysis is an excellent opinion-mining tool to derive deeper insights from the digital space, especially in analyzing insights from structured data. However, it needs to give deeper context and meaning to the same data, which semantic analysis does.Semantic Analysis is a sub-field of NLP that not just picks up relevant critical phrases in data but finds more profound meaning in natural language while correlating them. The role of machines in understanding and interpreting data is limited, given the vast complexity and subjectivity involved in natural language. But semantics captures this meaning, bringing context, logical sentence structure, and grammar connotation into it.Classification of Semantic AnalyticsDivided into two broad parts, semantic analytics can be classified into;Lexical Semantic Analysis – This tries to understand the meaning of each word of the text separately. The definition refers to the dictionary meaning of the word we all know.Compositional Semantic Analysis – Even though it is possible to know the meaning of every individual word of a text, it isn’t always possible to understand the whole purpose of the sentence from them.For example, NLP is an insight-driven branch of AI & AI that uses NLP to derive insights – these are two sentences with the exact ‘root’ words but convey very different meanings.Compositional semantic analysis tries to understand how different word combinations can derive meaning from texts.How does Semantic Analysis work?By understanding the meaning of words by themselves and in combination with others, semantic analysis works according to the below significant processes.Word Sense DisambiguationRelationship ExtractionWord Sense DisambiguationIn the case of natural language, every word used in a sentence differs in meaning according to context, reference, or occurrence. In Word Sense Disambiguation, the meaning of words is interpreted based on the context of their event in a sentence.For example, the word ‘fine’ may be ‘making all right’ or ‘payment for defaulting’ based on the context of its usage within the text.In essence, the machine is doing some part of what we do in verbalizing natural language. For example, this process overcomes the ambiguity in understanding and identifying the meaning of a word based on its context and use.Relationship ExtractionThe semantic analysis does a crucial task called Relationship Extraction, involving identifying different entities present in a sentence and then extracting their relationships to each other.For example, in the sentence, ‘Charlee.ai led insurance analytics predicts user behavior,’ the entities in red, when correlated, derive the below interpretation,The ability of Semantic Analysis to derive contextual inferences and meanings from natural language is based on certain key elements that are elaborated on below;Hyponymy: This refers to an instance of generic terminology. For example, cats, dogs, and goats are hyponyms, while ‘animals’ is a hypernym.Homonymy: Homonymy refers to two or more terminologies that spell the same but with entirely different meanings. For example, ‘Float’ can be ‘moving on water’ or ‘put forth.’ Float is a homonym.Synonymy: These are two or more terminologies that spell differently but have the same meaning. Hit/ Strike and Mourn/Grieve are examples of this.Antonymy: Antonymy, like the English verbiage, refers to a pair of terms with contrasting meanings but relevant to the same subject, such as Hot/Cold and Big/Small.Polysemy: Terms with the exact spelling but various closely related meanings come under polysemy. This is similar to short-tail and long-tail keywords in SEO. Therefore a word like ‘injury‘ may mean ‘skin injury‘ or ‘unforeseen injury or ‘an injury that is severe‘ – having different meanings but bearing a close association.Meronomy: Meronomy refers to the relationship of one term to its larger constituent entity. ‘Wheel‘ is, therefore, a meronym of ‘Automobile, ‘and ‘Hands’ are a meronomy of ‘body.’ConclusionSemantic analysis is the way machines understand textual information. While for humans, it is simple to understand tone and context; this NLP-based technique represents texts in specific formats to interpret their meaning. This task is done by assessing new data, comparing it against existing past data, and helping predict claims cycle times, severity, and loss while foreseeing user behavior, enabling the insurance industry to save time and money and improve reserve management and risk selection.PARTS 123Written by: Dr. Charmaine Kenita",

In Word Sense Disambiguation, the meaning of words is interpreted based on the context of their event in a sentence.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">For example, the word ‘fine’ may be ‘making all right’ or ‘payment for defaulting’ based on the context of its usage within the text.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">In essence, the machine is doing some part of what we do in verbalizing natural language. For example, this process overcomes the ambiguity in understanding and identifying the meaning of a word based on its context and use.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Relationship Extraction</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">The semantic analysis does a crucial task called Relationship Extraction, involving identifying different entities present in a sentence and then extracting their relationships to each other.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">For example, in the sentence, ‘Charlee.ai led insurance analytics predicts user behavior,’ the entities in <span style={{color: '#ff0000'}}>red</span>, when correlated, derive the below interpretation,</p>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/charlee-ai-insurance-analytics-1024x1024.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Conclusion</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Semantic analysis is the way machines understand textual information. While for humans, it is simple to understand tone and context; this NLP-based technique represents texts in specific formats to interpret their meaning. This task is done by assessing new data, comparing it against existing past data, and helping predict claims cycle times, severity, and loss while foreseeing user behavior, enabling the insurance industry to save time and money and improve reserve management and risk selection.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Request a Demo:</h2>\r\n            <form action=\"https://charlee.ai/part-2-sentiment-analysis-with-nlp-next-gen-ai-in-insur-tech/\" method=\"post\" className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"firstname\" className=\"block\">First Name <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"text\" name=\"firstname\" id=\"firstname\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"First Name *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"lastname\" className=\"block\">Last Name <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"text\" name=\"lastname\" id=\"lastname\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"Last Name *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"phone_number\" className=\"block\">Phone Number</label>\r\n                        <input type=\"tel\" name=\"phone_number\" id=\"phone_number\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" placeholder=\"888-888-8888\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"email\" className=\"block\">Email <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" id=\"email\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"@email *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                    <p>I would like to:</p>\r\n                    <div className=\"flex flex-col\">\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Learn more about the Free POC *\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Learn more about the Free POC *\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Receive Product Information\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Receive Product Information\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Request a Demo\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Request a Demo\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Receive your Whitepaper\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Receive your Whitepaper\r\n                        </label>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"mt-4 text-right\">\r\n                    <button type=\"submit\" className=\"bg-teal-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded\">Submit</button>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </form>\r\n        </div>"

Drawing out the plain meaning from text, understanding and interpreting text based on context, patterns, and structure, and identifying relationships between words open the field to understanding and working on structured and unstructured data more deeply.A semantic analytics tool like Charlee™ is pre-trained for personal and commercial automobile and general liability insurance management. It can automatically extract meaningful information from unstructured data such as claim notes, PDFs, and news articles to provide unique data insights that will help make a significant decision. In the InsureTech space, this can predict severity, loss, and other outcomes; offer deeper insights into claims performance, and foresee user behavior patterns to help businesses make real-time, on-the-go, accurate data-driven decisions.CONCLUSIONNLP-based Sentiment Analysis, also called ‘Opinion Mining,’ is instrumental in deriving data insights in the digital realm, especially in analyzing sentiments from structured text data like emails, chat transcripts, social comments, and reviews. However, complementing it with Semantic Analytics opens immense possibilities to explore meaningful insights in structured and unstructured data, which is critical to better outcomes in claims management.PARTS 123Written by: Dr. Charmaine Kenita\n\nREQUEST A DEMO:\n\n",

The grammatical analysis and recognition connection between words in a given context enables algorithms to comprehend and interpret phrases, sentences, and all forms of data.In its simplest form, semantic analysis is the process that extracts meaning from text. While it is already being used to drive chatbots, search engines, and text analysis using machine learning, its niche applications are effectively utilized in underwriting risk prediction and claims outcome prediction in the InsureTech domain by Charlee.ai, a patented insight-driven NLP engine.In the previous article, we have understood the two processes that drive semantic analysis and the key elements that help derive contextual inferences and meanings from natural language.Deriving meaning from data makes semantic analysis a differentiator from other Machine Learning techniques. It is straightforward for humans to understand the deeper meaning of textual information, but machines work differently. They represent texts in specific formats to interpret their meaning. The formal structure used to understand the importance of the text is called ‘meaning representation.’Units of semantic analysis1. Entity – This refers to a particular unit or an individual, such as a person or location. For example, Charlee, claims2. Concept – This is a broad generalization of entities or a more general class of individual units. For example, engine, portfolio3. Relations – This establishes the relationship between different concepts and entities. For example, Charlee is an NLP-based engine; the Claims portfolio is manageable.4. Predicate – These represent the verb structures of the sentences.Semantic Analysis techniquesText Classification:In ‘Text Classification,’ the aim is to label the text according to the insights gained from the textual data.For instance.In Sentiment Analysis, the text is labeled according to its prominent emotion. This can help in analyzing customer reviews for improving products or solutions.In Topic Classification, texts are categorized into some predefined categories. For example, they identify whether a book is sci-fi, autobiographical, or fiction.In Intent Classification, we are trying to know the intent behind the text message and, for example, identifying whether an email query received by a customer was a complaint, question, or request.Text ExtractionText extraction involves drawing out specific information from the text.In Keyword Extraction, we try getting essential words that capture the gist of the entire document.In Entity Extraction, we try to draw out all entities involved in a document.CONCLUSIONBusinesses are already using Semantic Analysis in various ways for social listening, such as Uber releasing new versions of its app, which picks up users’ assessment and feedback from how they post about it on social media.Google’s Humming Bird algorithm, made in 2013, uses semantic analysis to make search results more relevant, improving organic and natural referencing (SEO) to build quality content on website pages.In the InsurTech industry, NLP-based semantic analysis in conjunction with other Machine Learning techniques, as demonstrated by Charlee.ai, uses unstructured data such as claim notes, PDF documents, comments, and files to accurately understand behavioral patterns from a corpus of past unstructured data and look for the same in new data, accurately predict insurance claims cycle times and foresee user behavior.PARTS 123Written by: Dr. Charmaine KenitaTechnology and Business WriterandJohn StandishCo-founder & CIO\n\nREQUEST A DEMO:\n\n",

    "content": "Over the last decade, Artificial Intelligence or AI has become synonymous with new technology. Broadly it is a term used by many to mean many things.  In its simplest form, AI is the ability of technology to perform tasks associated with intelligent beings. Inborn characteristics of humans, such as the ability to reason, think and configure, discover meaning and insights, and learn from past experiences – are complex tasks that new-age technologies like AI can undertake and solve with excellent proficiency.To understand AI is to go deeper into intelligence and what meaning we derive from it. Psychologists characterize human intelligence as the inherent trait to combine diverse abilities- learning, reasoning, problem-solving, language, and perception. Most living beings can use these traits singularly, including animals and insects. But combining them into a single powerful feature lends a complexity that only humans can leverage. AI technology replicates this, constantly evolving to undertake simultaneous large and complex functionalities to make future decisions and take action.Since AI is purported to make machines emulate human-like functionalities, the degree to which AI can replicate human capabilities is the criteria used to determine AI types.BROAD AI CLASSIFICATIONSAI can be classified;Based on Functionalities: This classifies AI based on its ability to think and likeness to the human mind. There are four types of AI-based systems in this category:Reactive Machines – One of the oldest forms of AI, their capabilities are minimal and only based on responding to stimuli. They do not have memory functions, cannot remember and store information, or learn and give insights based on past knowledge. A famous example of this machine is IBM’s Deep Blue, which beat chess Grandmaster Gary Kasparov in 1997.Limited Memory Machines – Besides having reactive capabilities, such machines can make decisions based on historical data. Most present-day systems that use deep learning are trained by large volumes of data stored in memory as a reference model to solve future problems. Chatbots and Virtual Assistants are typical examples of this.Theory of Mind – Touted as the next level of AI systems currently being innovated, these systems have been proposed to understand better the entities they interact with, discerning their emotions, feelings, beliefs, and thought flows. While artificial emotional intelligence is just a theory today, developing machines to understand humans is the next step in AI evolution.Self-awareness- Only hypothetical for now; these AI systems have evolved to think like the human brain and become self-aware. This is the ultimate objective of AI research, making a machine capable of experiencing emotions, needs, and desires.Based on Capabilities: This alternate system of classification separates AI into:Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) - All existing AI, including the most complicated and capable ones, fall under this category. ‘Narrow Intelligence’ refers to AI that can only perform one task autonomously using ‘human-like’ capabilities. They cannot do anything more than they are programmed to do, have a narrow range of competencies, and are more reactive or ‘limited memory’ AI.Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) – The ability of AI to learn, perceive, understand, and function as a human being gives it enormous, independent competencies, thereby reducing training times. This makes AI almost like humans in our way of functioning.Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) – This will mark the pinnacle of AI development when it manifests for real. ASI will be the most capable form of intelligence on earth, better than human beings in everything – more extraordinary memory, faster data processing, quicker analysis, and decision-making capabilities. The development of AGI and ASI will also lead to a scenario called ‘singularity,’ with massive intelligence and implications across industries.PRACTICAL APPLICABILITYRegarding applications in practice, AI can be classified based on where and how it is used.Analytic AI – Powered by Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques, this system scans tons of data for patterns and dependencies, producing recommendations that provide business insights to support data-driven decision-making. Sentiment Analysis and Supplier Risk Assessment are just two examples of this AI, performing functions like inventory optimization and demand forecasting in the manufacturing and FMCG industry.Functional AI – Very similar to Analytical AI, this system scans large amounts of data to derive patterns and dependencies. However, it doesn’t give recommendations but also acts based on them. For example, it can pick up machine parts breakdowns when deployed on cloud software and trigger commands to shut the faulty part down, going beyond just raising alerts.Interactive AI – As the name suggests, this system automates communication without compromising interactivity, like chatbots and personal assistants responding to prompts, providing relevant responses to questions, and understanding conversation contexts.Text AI – This system recognizes any data in text form, speech-to-text conversion, machine translation, and content generation. AI-powered text databases go beyond conventional keyword search capabilities to find contextual content and correlate information. Thanks to Semantic Analysis and Natural Language Processing or NLP, the AI builds semantic maps, recognizing synonyms to understand user context.For example, Charlee.ai’s A.I.-Based Predictive Analytics engine sifts through millions of past claims and unstructured data to accurately predict claims severity and litigation based on a continuous spectrum of pre-trained insights. It can also identify over 160 + insurance fraud schemes and meet deadlines outlined in the Fair Claims Practices Act to help insurance carriers stay compliant.  Visual AI- Using visual aids to identify, classify, and sort objects or convert images and videos into insights is what this AI system. Helping insurers estimate damages to automobiles based on damaged car photos is the capability of this AI, which also covers augmented reality.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAI capabilities are developing rapidly, and their intervention is helping solve hitherto impossible scenarios and identify low and high-severity claims, like in the insurance industry, with quick intervention while bringing down costs and time wastage in mundane, repetitive, error-prone tasks. Businesses already use it across industries in various capacities, and leveraging it has multiple long-term benefits.Written by: Dr. Charmaine Kenita\n\nTechnology and Business Writer\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\nJohn Standish\n\n\n\nCo-founder & CIO\n\n\n\nREQUEST A DEMO:\n\n",

It frees us how we are helped performing tasks, often taking hours and days of strenuous manual labor.

    "content": "Consider a jigsaw puzzle with pieces you must find and put together. The task is easy and can be finished quickly if it’s a small puzzle of less than ten pieces. But consider a puzzle of less than 100 pieces. Besides understanding the picture and connecting all the pieces, it also becomes essential not to lose the relevance of one puzzle piece while trying to find and join the others.A seasoned claims adjuster handed a stack of claims files is going through the process of putting together the puzzle with the pieces provided. Each claim file is filled with lengthy, dense texts that include accident reports, notes and scribbles, medical records, and unstructured text data. The adjuster has to manually sift through this entire trove of information to identify critical details, note discrepancies in claims statements, go through past claims records, spot inconsistencies, and determine the claim’s risk, stage of complexity, and validity. Straightforward claims are easy to manage and resolve. But claims with hundreds of notes, vague or haphazard data points, and gaps in narration can be mentally taxing and time intensive, with some crucial information falling through the cracks that may or may not be grasped till much later.Now, picture all the above claims adjuster tasks being performed with the assistance of an insurance-trained Large Language Model (LLM) at a speed and scale much beyond human capacity, at a fraction of the cost, and with ten times the accuracy.Given the humungous amounts of text data generated during the claims process, LLMs can significantly transform the claims management process. By doing the heavy lifting and taking over large parts of workload processing, AI models can optimize and expedite the claims process, increase accuracy, bring down costs, and substantially minimize the operational burden.THE VALUE OF DATAClaims systems are often a mix of structured and unstructured data. While the former can be read and referenced by claims adjusters, the latter cannot be easily understood. Besides, missing pieces or inconsistencies can present an incomplete picture of the claims, leading to erroneous conclusions. LLMs can unlock the validity of unstructured text data, providing a larger comprehensive overview that can help arrive at better outcomes.SIMPLIFYING COMPLEXITIESLLMs cannot just read unstructured data but can capture the nuances, contextual relevance, and details that adjusters often miss after the FNOL. By gathering observations, insights, and descriptions, a more detailed holistic picture of the claim is painted to arrive at better conclusions. For example, in claims with bodily injuries, knowing whether the damage is recent, an aggravation of a previous injury, or a medical condition unrelated to the case can help classify the claim based on risks. This can help manage reserves efficiently, avoid early attorney intervention, and resolve the issue quickly.MANAGING UNFORESEEN CHALLENGESLeveraging the unique insights of LLMs to improve claims management processes to achieve low costs and better outcomes gives insurers an edge, especially in today’s challenging markets, volatile conditions, and unpredictable situations. Pretrained on large claims datasets, such LLM models can build deep insights into the claims trajectory and flow, predicting claims behaviors.CONCLUSIONClaims LLMs, like those integrated in Charlee.ai, work as an advanced technology engine, partnering with analysts to provide hitherto hidden insights and automate insurance operations. Pre-trained on carrier data across various lines, our claim LLM can interpret and summarize unstructured data and documents to benefit all kinds of insurers within insurance compliance parameters to assess, predict and help improve workflows and reduce loss expenses.Written by: Dr. Charmaine Kenita\n\nTechnology and Business Writer\n\n\n\nREQUEST A DEMO:\n\n",

LLMs can unlock the validity of unstructured text data, providing a larger comprehensive overview that can help arrive at better outcomes.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">SIMPLIFYING COMPLEXITIES</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">LLMs cannot just read unstructured data but can capture the nuances, contextual relevance, and details that adjusters often miss after the FNOL. By gathering observations, insights, and descriptions, a more detailed holistic picture of the claim is painted to arrive at better conclusions. For example, in claims with bodily injuries, knowing whether the damage is recent, an aggravation of a previous injury, or a medical condition unrelated to the case can help classify the claim based on risks. This can help manage reserves efficiently, avoid early attorney intervention, and resolve the issue quickly.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/THE-VALUE-OF-CLAIMS-Large-Language-Models-image3.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">MANAGING UNFORESEEN CHALLENGES</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Leveraging the unique insights of LLMs to improve claims management processes to achieve low costs and better outcomes gives insurers an edge, especially in today’s challenging markets, volatile conditions, and unpredictable situations. Pretrained on large claims datasets, such LLM models can build deep insights into the claims trajectory and flow, predicting claims behaviors.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">CONCLUSION</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Claims LLMs, like those integrated in Charlee.ai, work as an advanced technology engine, partnering with analysts to provide hitherto hidden insights and automate insurance operations. Pre-trained on carrier data across various lines, our claim LLM can interpret and summarize unstructured data and documents to benefit all kinds of insurers within insurance compliance parameters to assess, predict and help improve workflows and reduce loss expenses.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><strong><em>Written by: Dr. Charmaine Kenita</em></strong></p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><em><strong>Technology and Business Writer</strong></em></p>\r\n            \r\n            <h2 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Request a Demo:</h2>\r\n            <form action=\"https://charlee.ai/part-2-claims-large-language-models-and-their-value/\" method=\"post\" className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"firstname\" className=\"block\">First Name <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"text\" name=\"firstname\" id=\"firstname\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"First Name *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"lastname\" className=\"block\">Last Name <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"text\" name=\"lastname\" id=\"lastname\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"Last Name *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"phone_number\" className=\"block\">Phone Number</label>\r\n                        <input type=\"tel\" name=\"phone_number\" id=\"phone_number\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" placeholder=\"888-888-8888\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"email\" className=\"block\">Email <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" id=\"email\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"@email *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                    <p>I would like to:</p>\r\n                    <div className=\"flex flex-col\">\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"LITIGATION MANAGMENT DASHBOARD\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            LITIGATION MANAGMENT DASHBOARD\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"SEVERITY MANAGMENT DASHBOARD\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            SEVERITY MANAGMENT DASHBOARD\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"CLAIMS PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DASHBOARD\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            CLAIMS PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DASHBOARD\r\n                        </label>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"mt-4 text-right\">\r\n                    <button type=\"submit\" className=\"bg-teal-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded\">Submit</button>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </form>\r\n        </div>"

    "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is mentioned daily in the news media.  The popularity of AI is exponentially increasing every month as new ideas and products are introduced in the marketplace.  These new products are exciting and innovative, but will they stand up to scrutiny and authorization by regulatory agencies overseeing technology in their specific business domain? In the insurance business, regulators have tackled the task of drafting model bulletins and regulations governing the use of AI in the underwriting and claims processes. The regulators are viewing the concern of biased AI and the consequences that will harm consumers.Ethical AI is a popular topic in the InsureTech Community, and it must stay at the forefront of innovation and deployment of solutions for insurance carriers and stakeholders. The NAIC H Committee has drafted a model bulletin for insurance carriers to follow using AI with specific points on how the carriers can be held accountable.In 2019, the Health Ethics and Policy Lab<1> defined ethical AI from a global convergence of moral principles: 1. Transparency; 2. Justice; 3. Fairness; 4. Non-maleficence; 5. Responsibility; and 6. Privacy.  These principles are on point and very important in developing and deploying AI solutions in our society.Ethics is defined as moral principles that govern a person’s behavior or the conduct of an activity. A typical example of ethics daily is “Do the right thing even when nobody is watching!” InsureTech companies cannot take shortcuts in developing their solutions, and insurance carriers must be ready to ask pointed questions regarding models and insights delivered by AI.For the context of InsureTech, the basic principles for ethical AI are:1. Factual. The data AI analyzes for insights and predictions must be accurate and related to the information in the policy, claim file, and any external (third-party) data applicable to the facts of the loss or the underwriting process.2. Accurate. The AI algorithms must be tested, vetted, and continuously checked for accuracy. Bias exists everywhere and must be recognized and tuned for precise analysis and predictions.3. Explainable. The highly regulated insurance business has no “Black Box” in AI for underwriting or claims. The consumer and the insurance carrier need to know how the AI makes decisions, predictions, and recommendations throughout the underwriting and claims process.4. Articulate. The AI must articulate how and where the insight, pattern, and recommendation will help the underwriter and claims examiner.5. Transparent. The AI must be transparent in its process so the practitioner and end user can understand how it works and how the user arrives at the decision.6. Testable. The AI must be able to be tested automatically to generate better results as it continuously analyzes data. This is one of the basic concepts of machine learning. Therefore, we can define ethical AI in insurance as the principal governance of machine learning and natural language processing to analyze data for insights that will safeguard consumers and insurance carriers accurately, transparently, and factually. The growth of AI is exponentially expanding in our lives and must be appropriately created, governed, and continuously monitored.CONCLUSIONWhile ethics in InsureTech AI are defined by a set of rules, ensuring their technological integration is equally important. Translating human-centric theoretical principles into technology-led practical applications requires the building of AI Engines that ensure transparency and trust throughout the claims management process without compromising on regulatory frameworks at any point in time. In Part 2 we explore how To Build AI Ethically and what does this entail.<1> https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1906/1906.11668.pdfPARTS 123Written by: Dr. Charmaine Kenita\n\nTechnology and Business Writer\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\nJohn Standish\n\n\n\nCo-founder & CIO\n\n\n\nREQUEST A DEMO:\n\n",

These principles are on point and very important in developing and deploying AI solutions in our society.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Ethics is defined as moral principles that govern a person’s behavior or the conduct of an activity. A typical example of ethics daily is “Do the right thing even when nobody is watching!” InsureTech companies cannot take shortcuts in developing their solutions, and insurance carriers must be ready to ask pointed questions regarding models and insights delivered by AI.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">For the context of InsureTech, the basic principles for ethical AI are:</h3>\r\n            <ul className=\"mt-4 list-disc list-outside pl-4\">\r\n                <li><strong>Factual</strong>. The data AI analyzes for insights and predictions must be accurate and related to the information in the policy, claim file, and any external (third-party) data applicable to the facts of the loss or the underwriting process.</li>\r\n                <li><strong>Accurate</strong>. The AI algorithms must be tested, vetted, and continuously checked for accuracy. Bias exists everywhere and must be recognized and tuned for precise analysis and predictions.</li>\r\n                <li><strong>Explainable</strong>. The highly regulated insurance business has no “Black Box” in AI for underwriting or claims. The consumer and the insurance carrier need to know how the AI makes decisions, predictions, and recommendations throughout the underwriting and claims process.</li>\r\n                <li><strong>Articulate</strong>. The AI must articulate how and where the insight, pattern, and recommendation will help the underwriter and claims examiner.</li>\r\n                <li><strong>Transparent</strong>. The AI must be transparent in its process so the practitioner and end user can understand how it works and how the user arrives at the decision.</li>\r\n                <li><strong>Testable</strong>. The AI must be able to be tested automatically to generate better results as it continuously analyzes data. This is one of the basic concepts of machine learning.</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/Ethical-AI-The-Six-Pillars-For-Insurance-part1-image2.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">CONCLUSION</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Therefore, we can define ethical AI in insurance as the principal governance of machine learning and natural language processing to analyze data for insights that will safeguard consumers and insurance carriers accurately, transparently, and factually. The growth of AI is exponentially expanding in our lives and must be appropriately created, governed, and continuously monitored.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">While ethics in InsureTech AI are defined by a set of rules, ensuring their technological integration is equally important. Translating human-centric theoretical principles into technology-led practical applications requires the building of AI Engines that ensure transparency and trust throughout the claims management process without compromising on regulatory frameworks at any point in time.

It is sweeping across industries, changing how we work, live, travel, and learn. However, a tool as powerful as AI, especially in the insurance and financial domain, is more than helping improve lives. It is closely tied to the outcome of somebody’s life and property. When it comes to using AI to do tangible things, like analyzing data from a car accident photo or figuring out the impact of floods and associated costs during a cyclone, the tasks are objective, and the purpose is to make life easy for analysts. However, the question of ethics in AI insurance must be addressed when it comes to data associated with humans.Human beings and anything associated with them are relevant data that can be analyzed and predicted. In insurance, every data point is personal and sensitive, whether it is a policyholder’s payment history or personal data like address, SSN, contact numbers/email, and health issues required for the underwriting process. It cannot be made available for everyone to access. As soon as people are touched by a data point anywhere in their insurance journey, the question of ethics arises because it entails a breach of their personal information.Three Dangers of AI’s training data1. Mismanaged or Biased DataData drives the insurance industry. Data helps make decisions, from crucial underwriting and risk assessment to more straightforward customer interaction and marketing. With the exponential growth of structured and unstructured data, the need for technological intervention in AI to make quicker, better-informed decisions is even more critical, considering the value it adds to operational efficiency and the company’s bottom line. Harnessing the potential of large volumes of data and deriving insights from it can help decision-making, impacting workforce manual work and bringing more accuracy and efficiency to everyday insurance tasks. Big-data technologies like AI can strengthen the InsurTech platform in deriving and managing data-driven tasks, giving companies a competitive advantage and better-serving customers.But AI, in its free form, can be very unregulated. Suppose the data it is built upon comes from questionable or non-credible sources. In that case, if the algorithms are flawed, and if there are loopholes in the tool used, it can invalidate every insight and considerably impact decision-making and claims handling, risk assessment, and fraud management processes. The question of using AI in insurance is redundant, given the strides it has already made. Still, with continuous technological advancement, its use is expanding rapidly, and so is the challenge to keep it within a regulated framework. Today, it has become imperative to ensure that data-driven decision-making tools like AI are used ethically in ways that can help in the insurance management process and, in turn, customers rather than harming them with bias. But what is most important is knowing whether such tools are used ethically to enhance customer trust instead of damaging it.2. Current Insurance RegulationsThe insurance industry is addressing the challenges arising from ethically led insurance software within the ambit of security and safety of customer data, guided by government regulations and oversight bodies across global, regional, and country levels. AI tools used from open sources make insurance data vulnerable to security threats and hacks. The algorithms and processes interpreting and making decisions on that data must be vetted and safeguarded at every level, and human intervention is made part of decision-making. While the legal standpoint of ethics thus far mainly works around data privacy and protection of personally identifiable information, governed by industry laws, it is the onus on the people building the AI tool to ensure that data is not compromised and ethical handling of insurance tasks at every step becomes non-negotiable. Regulators have started to draft and promulgate regulations for the use of AI in the underwriting process, focusing on two critical issues: One, discrimination against protected classes of people, and two, mandated testing for bias in the algorithms. As AI advancements continue and more insurance carriers use these advanced technologies, more regulations and reporting will become the norm.3.

    "content": "It is the tool that maketh the man, goes a famous saying. In the case of artificial intelligence (AI) - the tool transforming how we analyze data and process information, the ramifications of its use are far-reaching and with life-altering consequences. Since time immemorial, human intervention in business processes has come about from trial and error towards simplifying processes and streamlining critical thinking. The insurance industry has entailed setting up functional workflows, changing process maps, business reengineering, resource alignment, and more. With the exponential growth of the insurance industry across various products and lines over the decades, the multitude of processes to keep operations well-oiled and running, the complexity of claims processes and data insights to keep up with workflows, human intervention in insurance is falling short of the needed quality and expertise. Analysts today are heavily burdened with a deluge of claims, missing out on critical red flags, lengthening reconciliation processes, increased payouts by insurers, and litigation. Using AI to help with tangible things, analyze unstructured data such as claim notes and documents across many carriers and lines, identify patterns in data to pre-empt and mitigate potential loss, and warn insurers of reserves insufficiency would certainly help reduce claims cycle time and expenses.As with any new technology such as AI, there is also a concern with unwarranted outcomes. This is where ethics plays a significant role, given how insurance touches people’ everyday lives – from their health to their property, their modes of transport to businesses they operate, to the place they live and work. The way AI is leveraged thus defines its ethical or unethical usage. With humans making decisions, controlling processes, and putting checks and measures in place, business processes can significantly benefit from having a technological intervention defined by ethics that safeguards the decisions made by humans based on AI. Compliance and other legal and regulatory mandates suffice in influencing the use of AI. But these are constantly changing. In addition, since it is the human with decision-making capabilities and AI insights that will decide its use - from identifying data patterns and their relevance to probability matrix and risk assessment - it is also human thinking alone that can pull out best practices from past experiences and their outcomes. From measuring ROI, placing checks and balances throughout workflows, and predicting the future behavior of claims to identify and intervene at critical points in the cycle, governing the use of such technology is essential.While ethics can be considered an all-encompassing subject and can have different connotations for different industries, in the insurance domain, especially in relation to InsureTech, below are the 3 points to consider in deploying and using ethical AI.1. Implementation - It is one thing to design and code AI within regulatory frameworks but another to implement it ethically. Implementation underlines applications that have to adhere to specific rules at every step. Because it handles large amounts of structured and unstructured data, insurance processes must be governed by sound implementation at every step, ensure data is factual, and accurately represent the claims and other circumstances, all the time controlled by compliance and other regulatory practices. Workflows that depend on outcomes from AI applications must have human-centric checks to explain the decisions taken. For e.g. claim scoring – system-generated claim score must be clearly understood and implemented within workflows by humans who clearly understand the score criteria and can intervene when needed.2. Human Interaction - The design of the AI workflow within the claims system has to be done considering human interactions at every step. People will access, guide, and input information in the AI system and influence the results inferred from data to make future decisions. Humans are the critical component of the AI matrix. For e.g. fraud detection software must be able to explain suspected fraudulent attributes or indicators that scored or flagged claims as suspected fraudulent. These claims must be reviewed for those indicators before further action is taken in the automated workflow. Explainable AI must help humans understand the logic behind the machine-learned patterns so humans can accept or reject as needed. 3. Accurate and timely Measurement of KPIs and overall ROI of AIAccurate – Data is a large canvas open to interpretation of all kinds. Data can also be misrepresented, misinterpreted, and skewed depending on the biases or prejudices of those drawing insights or conclusions from that data. Ethics means ensuring that the most accurate, unbiased learnings are extracted from AI-driven technologies, helping uphold the various workflows and processes, and drawing fair conclusions that can help make accurate predictions in claims processes and risk assessments.AI solutions detecting patterns must be periodically pre-trained, tested and refreshed. This is key. Domain experts must become masters of the outcomes before implementing within workflows for staff to operate with due diligence. The AI domain experts / super users can assess the outcomes from AI based insights and predictions before implementing them into current workflows.Timely - Time is critical in the management of insurance processes. Be it assessing Risks – learning from past ones and applying them to understand new risks; Resources or people who have to make decisions promptly – using it to understand past, present, or future insights; and ROI – how well is the new AI system helping processes, measurement of customer satisfaction, reduction of expenses, other indicators of the effectiveness of AI systems; ethics overarches the monitoring and evaluation of such tech systems at every step.AI solutions have to be ROI-checked periodically for initially established financial goals. ROI is time-sensitive in how its measured, what models need to be refreshed, and how often and how and when it is tested and delivered. Change in workflows and operational behaviors in this new AI insights-driven business process will yield different outcomes, which need to be measured periodically. CONCLUSIONAI is a godsend for Insuretech in the many ways and versatile insights it provides claims examiners, expanding how they think and utilize data to simplify workflows. Besides making jobs easy, it also helps teams improve performance, focus on critical matters, expend energy on necessary tasks, and significantly reduce spending. When governed by ethics, it provides a level playing field for insurers while ensuring that data gathering isn’t contaminated or biased towards specific thought.PARTS 123Written by: Dr. Charmaine Kenita\n\nTechnology and Business Writer\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\nJohn Standish\n\n\n\nCo-founder & CIO\n\n\n\nREQUEST A DEMO:\n\n",

    "content": "Like the holiday serving platter overflowing onto the dinner table, satiating our appetites, and building the excitement for all that is to unfold in our lives this new year, so too are the platter of abundant choices available to customers across the insurance domain. From tech-enabled processes to insights-driven engagement and tailored reinsurance services, the abundance is apparent, yet one that should be tempered with reasoning and intelligent choices. The insurance industry is facing an inflection point- the build-up of InsureTech-led AI initiatives over the years has brought us to a threshold of a buffet of seamless experiences. However, to utilize them effectively and capably, other factors such as ethics in AI insurance, value creation, granularity in decision-making, and precision in insurers’ choices will unveil what can be looked forward to in how the rest of the year follows. Based on our experiences, research trends, forecasts, industry talks, and discussions, below is what we foresee for this year regarding how the insurance industry will unfold.1.\tInnovation and transformation will be at the core of value-driven services. Change is happening all around us at a pace more rapid than in all of the preceding decades. Significant shifts in climate, the workforce, technology, and customer expectations combined with the constant geopolitical volatility and macroeconomic conditions are compelling organizations to pivot quickly.  They must adopt technological infrastructure, change business models, and adapt to new organizational culture to remain relevant, boost profitability, and survive. While this means businesses must think independently, they must constantly reinvent and adapt to the marketplace. With insurance being society’s financial safety net, the growing volatility worldwide and financially unsupportable risks are mandating insurers to play a more significant role in managing catastrophic climate change, growth of cybercrime, and constant disruptions across sectors like automobile and commercial insurance intelligently. Preventing and mitigating risks will depend on the insurer’s ability to pre-mediate, predict, and be ready at all times for any eventualities that may arise in the foreseeable future.2.\tThe intersection of technology to optimize business processes for all stakeholders – With a mainly retiring workforce, ‘quiet quitting’ of employees across insurance lines, and manual interventions being unable to keep up with the claims volume, technology is seen as a game-changer in this transformational change. With the adoption of new technologies like generative AI, predictive analytics and others that can harvest actionable insights from past claims data, the playing field for talent to merge with data sources and skill sets is vast, with significantly transformative results.3.\tThe ethical impact of AI application and its use.The growing use of AI by insurers and customers raises new concerns about its usage and practical implications. Emerging challenges and opportunities are presenting various questions. With insights-driven data and a tool that can potentially transform the insurance space, ethics will play a significant role in leveraging it within compliance and other regulatory parameters and its impact on the larger good of the insurance industry.4. Growing awareness of personal risks as a potential opportunity for insurers.Coupled with rising inflation, citizens across the board realize their responsibility for their future health and retirement costs, a fallout of governments in advanced economies becoming more indebted and funding paucity for health and retirement programs (the United States Social Security program is experiencing funding gaps - Global Insurance Report 2023). Insurers can use such information to develop new products to bridge this coverage gap.5.\tRise of embedded insurance to significantly disrupt the industry.There is an increase in insurance premiums in the property and casualty businesses in third-party channels. This will dramatically affect insurers by bypassing insurance agents and other traditional sellers, causing chaos in direct-to-consumer insurance sales, and may even exclude legacy carriers altogether. With growing premiums across markets (US forecasted to be $722 billion by 2030, Deloitte), partnering with embedded parties or finding ways to tackle such service providers is the next big step. Auto insurers will likely have this as the most significant challenge this year.CONCLUSIONCustomer centricity and business efficiency are the two driving needs in today's insurance industry. Generative AI, predictive analytics, no-code / low code applications, APIs and others are lending significant advantages to the insurance value chain with their capabilities of data-driven insights, streamlining and optimizing workflows, and enhancing workforce productivity. Their intelligent adoption will depend mainly on insurers discarding a myopic understanding of customer pain points to gain a more extensive, macro view of their enterprise data capabilities. Whether obtaining such tech-capabilities in-house or from outside vendors, such Insure-tech initiatives, will only help further the industry’s mission and vision for the future while focusing on environmental and economic impacts without compromise on profits.About Charlee.aiCharlee.ai is a patented, predictive analytics platform solution that uses natural language processing (NLP).

    "content": "Our world is fast-paced and changing rapidly. In the automobile sector, the number of vehicles on roads has increased including advanced vehicle technologies, and so has the unpredictability of weather and changing climate conditions. With an element of un-foreseeability thrown into everyday life despite certain predictable situations, insurers see an increase in payouts and claims complexities not just due to visible, tangible factors such as inflation and increased rates but due to intangibles like missed red flags during the first notice of loss (FNOL), and the lack of understanding of impactful facts of loss hidden in unstructured data.Claims management has, for the better part of several decades, been a reactive process - repairing, resolving, mitigating, and replacing; rather than a proactive and prepared response to situations. InsureTech initiatives such as AI today, are helping bring into the mix a degree of predictability and pre-emptive response management in handling claims, managing cycle times, recognizing risks, etc. Technology platforms are building a data-driven risk mitigation environment for Insurers, with insights driven from past claim patterns to predict future trends leveraging institutional knowledge captured within AI. Many leaders have been focusing their efforts mainly around the recent paradigm shift from ‘repair and replace’ to ‘predict, prioritize and prevent’ when looking at AI-based Risk Management solutions.Claims Director Brad Metzger, has worked in the P&C Industry for several years across diverse roles such as Claims Operations, Claims Strategy, and Claims IT. Having seen the rise of technology in claims management, he has a unique perspective in understanding and appreciating the need, to analyze and share claims data to understand emerging trends and risks. Below are his thoughts on how being proactive rather than reactive using tech-led data models, can greatly impact insurers and the decisions they make.Reconfiguring the approach to claims managementThere is no question that “predict and prevent” using customer-connected types of IoT devices adds value, but we see it as more of a redundant dependency or fail-safe kind of attribute. Many of the top 15 P&C Insurers in the US have implemented “predict and prevent” solutions. Still, as evidenced by soaring combined ratios, it is not yet proven to reduce overall claims frequency and severity results. As an aside, there is an argument to be made about the value in the Casualty space with “predict and prevent” vs. Physical / Material Damage, where most of the money and effort is going.Many other insights need to be factored in when building out technology models to manage and mitigate risks. The most important of them in the P&C space is collaboration across different departments by sharing data insights. Access and insight to a wide range of data allows underwriters to learn from claims in real-time or near real time, and claims staff to make more informed decisions. Insurance advertisements today focus on why they should be chosen as the insurance carrier rather than educating analysts about various coverages, or impact of fraud and litigation, protecting against certain risks, weather event notifications and emerging risks. Insurance product marketing should be about establishing trust and connecting to their policyholders through claims knowledge, which is key to marketing. Actuaries would benefit immensely from deeper insights from claims, rather than traditional structured data based triangles for rate making and stat reserving.Strategic Insights as the DifferentiatorMy most recent work using and sharing claims data to provide strategic insights was with Charlee.AI. Charlee.ai is an up-and-coming Insurtech company using natural language processing, claims large language models and machine learning to derive deep insights using unstructured data and use them in predicting high severity, litigation, fraud, attorney involvement including efficiency in managing reserves. I led a pilot team employing Charlee on several use cases. Among the key learnings of using the InsureTech engine was that Charlee™ provided actionable insights through quantitative predictions on injury claims so that the representative could make informed decisions on predicting severity, likelihood of attorney involvement, and potential litigation. This lead to workflow changes, ensuring proactive management of claims, with high severity and expense risks and unusual patterns or behavior. The result of applying Charlee™ was compressed end-to-end cycle times, reduction in attorney involvement and, ultimately, severity and reserving accuracy.  Reserving accuracy was not a KPI we agreed on measuring at the outset but ended up being a strategic insight and value-added consequence. Sharing the insights with the Enterprise Actuarial, Underwriting, and Pricing teams allows them to enhance several of their existing risk models.Necessity of a risk mitigation environmentIn my opinion, building an environment of risk mitigation for P&C Insurers involves a combination of advanced data analytics, technology, and strategic initiatives. Adoption is also equally critical. Getting key decision-makers to understand and prioritize effort and vision when it comes to establishing an environment of risk mitigation considerations tends to be a challenge. Especially as off late, the emphasis is more on near-term focus on results around underwriting profits and expense reduction to fuel growth. Below are other essential considerations necessary in creating an environment of data driven risk mitigation: Data collection and integration – Comprehensive and quality metrics from various sources (internal and external) and compliance with regulatory requirements are essential. This involves continuous updates of predictive models and risk assessments based on learning from across many carriers on current and emerging patterns.Loss prevention risk engineering – Dedicated teams that employ data-driven loss collaboration with policyholders to prevent and mitigate loss cost. Predictive modeling – Making sure advanced analytic teams and leaders understand that models need to have a narrow focus on data that can predict claims frequency, severity, and emerging trends (e.g., social inflation drivers). This includes real-time analysis during the underwriting process to quickly and accurately assess both risk and price. Investment in technology – Identify and implement emerging technologies that support data analytics, AI, and automation to enhance mitigation and risk assessment capabilities. Many insurers do not fully embrace the need for tests and learning. And that it is ok to learn fast and fail forward.Fraud Detection – Includes the ability to analyze underwriting and claims data for unusual patterns or behavior. The key here is early identification and investigation throughout the life of the policy. CONCLUSIONAI technology and its seismic impact on every aspect of the insurance ecosystem, especially in risk mitigation whether underwriting, pricing or claims management is obvious and far reaching. By ensuring greater data exchange and collaboration between departments promoting better transparency; leveraging data to enhance knowledge around possible and preventive claims scenarios; using technology as a ‘cyber supervisor’ to intervene at strategic decision-making junctures and boosting the capabilities of knowledge workers, AI adoption directly translates to claims risk mitigation. This in turn empowers institutional insurers to manage their operations from a ‘predict and prevent’ rather than a ‘react and restore’ standpoint.\n\nIn Part 3 of these series, we explore the topic of Claims Workflow Management and how AI intervention helps different stakeholders & parts of the process.Written by: Brad Metzger Claims DirectorandDr. Charmaine Kenita\n\nTechnology and Business Writer\n\n\n\nREQUEST A DEMO:\n\n",

In the automobile sector, the number of vehicles on roads has increased including advanced vehicle technologies, and so has the unpredictability of weather and changing climate conditions. With an element of un-foreseeability thrown into everyday life despite certain predictable situations, insurers see an increase in payouts and claims complexities not just due to visible, tangible factors such as inflation and increased rates but due to intangibles like missed red flags during the first notice of loss (FNOL), and the lack of understanding of impactful facts of loss hidden in unstructured data.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Claims management has, for the better part of several decades, been a reactive process – repairing, resolving, mitigating, and replacing; rather than a proactive and prepared response to situations. InsureTech initiatives such as AI today, are helping bring into the mix a degree of predictability and pre-emptive response management in handling claims, managing cycle times, recognizing risks, etc. Technology platforms are building a data-driven risk mitigation environment for Insurers, with insights driven from past claim patterns to predict future trends leveraging institutional knowledge captured within AI. Many leaders have been focusing their efforts mainly around the recent paradigm shift from ‘repair and replace’ to ‘predict, prioritize and prevent’ when looking at AI-based Risk Management solutions.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><em>Claims Director Brad Metzger, has worked in the P&amp;C Industry for several years across diverse roles such as Claims Operations, Claims Strategy, and Claims IT.

    "content": "THE PATHWAY TO IMPROVING THE FIRST NOTICE OF LOSS WITH AI‘It is always at the start that the momentum in sport is created,’ goes an often repeated saying. The beginning and pace at which a sport is set is where champions are made, championships are won, and careers get going. Track and field enthusiasts know how positive outcomes get a sprinter out of the blocks when the starter’s pistol shot is fired or how a swimmer’s lead in a race is set based on the kind of edge they can establish during the first lap. In claims management, the first few hours after an accident, a calamity, or loss provide the vital period required to gather data, establish facts, and chalk the incident's trajectory, setting the tone for the entire claims management cycle to unfold. This phase, called The First Notice of Loss (FNOL), must be flawless in gathering data and establishing what and how the incident happened, communicating the next steps to the customer, and assessing all possible exposures or applicable coverages.Claimant and third-party details, including past and present claims histories.Possibility of attorney involvement in cases of litigation and contended claims.Reserves are to be set aside for claims payout and management.Assessment of low, medium, or high-risk claims.Insights and behaviors that may influence pricing or settlements.THE IMPORTANCE OF FNOLThe first time the claimant informs the insurer of a loss, is when it is considered ‘making a claim.’ This is when the lifecycle of a formal claim begins and is very crucial both for the claimant and insurer. In the case of the former, it establishes the result of the policy the claimant has paid for and whether his claim will be dealt with swiftly, immediately, and within an adequate response time. In the case of the latter, it is a chance for the insurer to prove or validate their reputation in handling the claims quickly, ensuring a good resolution and justified settlement.Registering an FNOL requires the insurer to submit critical information - policy number, date and time of the loss, incident location, police report number, a personal account of how the incident occurred, and insurance information of the other party where required. In the case of a car accident, details given to an FNOL representative will include all the above, as well as questions about the nature and severity of the damage, history of the claimant, other driver’s testimony, police reports, witness accounts, medical report if any, observed damage to vehicles, etc.ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INSIGHTS – THE GAME CHANGERIn any incident report and subsequent investigation, the basics must be addressed: Who? What? When? Why? Where? And How? For the FNOL to be complete, this essential data must be registered and admitted into the claims management system accurately and efficiently. This is where AI's intervention phase has come to achieve vast significance. AI’s pattern recognition software and ability to derive deep insights based on past claims patterns from structured and unstructured data – claims notes, documents, third-party PDFs, and news articles – is helping configure unique insights that were hitherto often missed during claims registration. The gathering of such information is helping insurers predict claims trajectories in advance, allowing them to monitor the pulse of the allegations and the direction they are going in, and, from a business perspective, helping in better reserves management, risk assessment, and observation of annual trends.IN CONVERSATION WITH BRAD METZGER, CLAIMS DIRECTORBrad Metzger, having worked in the P&C Industry for several years across Claims Operations, Claims Strategy, and Claims IT, has first-hand experience of the impact of AI during FNOL. Having observed the insurance industry for over two decades and observing the criticality of data insights by AI intervention in claims management, he sheds light on why FNOL standardization using NLP-led AI engines can make the claims management process sharper, better, and more intelligent.Question: Brad, how important is the standardization of FNOL, and how can AI impact it during the claims process?The FNOL standardization is an essential part of claims management and must include the ability to connect to the insurance company virtually. Connecting IoT devices, such as crash detection and connected homes, makes the whole process seamless and sharp. This is what drives the value.Question: How do quick insights during FNOL, impact insurers and policyholders?The FNOL is when the first insights are gathered from the insured and people involved in the incident. Many seen and unseen insights can impact the trajectory of the claims in the future, ‘if and when’ picked up at this stage. Getting the loss details immediately after the loss helps insurers triage better based on customer needs. The earlier the data is gathered, the better it becomes to understand how insurers need to respond to the claimant, all in an effort to reduce the human trauma associated with the loss. This impacts both expenses and claims severity, especially in high-risk claims.Question: What interventions can AI do at this stage to speed up the claims process or identify critical data that may have been missed?Once the claims are registered, the insurer’s goal is to quickly meet and exceed the expectations of all constituents in the claims process, as the adjudication process has already started. This will result in happy customers, smiling faces, and mitigation of unnecessary indemnity and expense costs. More importantly, AI intervention can predict claims severity and the likelihood of social inflation factors such as attorney representation/litigation and get a jump start on posting accurate reserves.Question: What is the fallout of unfavorable outcomes during the claims process? How does it impact the insured and the insurer?Any delay or failure to gather relevant insights during the FNOL can increase claims cycle times and expenses, indemnity severity and also negatively impact the overall customer experience.Question: How do AI engines like Charlee™ help with the FNOL standardization? How can they streamline, simplify, and wrap up the claims management lifecycle?We have already established that the FNOL is the most crucial stage of the claim’s lifecycle. Getting as much information in this stage as possible will help ease several future processes, reduce cycle times, help better risk assessments, and predict claims severity well in advance.\nCharlee provides an NLP-driven claims summary, insights and predictions. This identifies gaps in information gathered, high priority claims for intelligent routing and assignment including workflow prioritization. An AI engine like Charlee is pre-trained for personal, automobile, and commercial insurance lines, picking insights from structured and unstructured data during FNOL and aiding claims analysts and managers with strategic insights and quantitative predictions to make real-time decisions while understanding and foreseeing user behavior patterns. \nCharlee.ai predicts litigation 90-120 days in advance with approximately 80% accuracy, starting at the First Notice of Loss (FNOL).In Part 2 of these series, we explore how AI can help in bridging the operational gap in insurance.Written by: Brad Metzger Claims DirectorandDr. Charmaine Kenita\n\nTechnology and Business Writer\n\n\n\nREQUEST A DEMO:\n\n",

The beginning and pace at which a sport is set is where champions are made, championships are won, and careers get going. Track and field enthusiasts know how positive outcomes get a sprinter out of the blocks when the starter’s pistol shot is fired or how a swimmer’s lead in a race is set based on the kind of edge they can establish during the first lap. In claims management, the first few hours after an accident, a calamity, or loss provide the vital period required to gather data, establish facts, and chalk the incident’s trajectory, setting the tone for the entire claims management cycle to unfold. This phase, called The First Notice of Loss (FNOL), must be flawless in gathering data and establishing what and how the incident happened, communicating the next steps to the customer, and assessing all possible exposures or applicable coverages.</p>\r\n            <ul className=\"mt-4 list-disc list-inside\">\r\n                <li>Claimant and third-party details, including past and present claims histories.</li>\r\n                <li>Possibility of attorney involvement in cases of litigation and contended claims.</li>\r\n                <li>Reserves are to be set aside for claims payout and management.</li>\r\n                <li>Assessment of low, medium, or high-risk claims.</li>\r\n                <li>Insights and behaviors that may influence pricing or settlements.</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/Standardization-of-FNOL-image2.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'contain', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">THE IMPORTANCE OF FNOL</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">The first time the claimant informs the insurer of a loss, is when it is considered ‘making a claim.’ This is when the lifecycle of a formal claim begins and is very crucial both for the claimant and insurer. In the case of the former, it establishes the result of the policy the claimant has paid for and whether his claim will be dealt with swiftly, immediately, and within an adequate response time. In the case of the latter, it is a chance for the insurer to prove or validate their reputation in handling the claims quickly, ensuring a good resolution and justified settlement.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Registering an FNOL requires the insurer to submit critical information – policy number, date and time of the loss, incident location, police report number, a personal account of how the incident occurred, and insurance information of the other party where required. In the case of a car accident, details given to an FNOL representative will include all the above, as well as questions about the nature and severity of the damage, history of the claimant, other driver’s testimony, police reports, witness accounts, medical report if any, observed damage to vehicles, etc.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/Standardization-of-FNOL-image3.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'contain', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INSIGHTS – THE GAME CHANGER</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">In any incident report and subsequent investigation, the basics must be addressed: Who? What? When? Why? Where? And How? For the FNOL to be complete, this essential data must be registered and admitted into the claims management system accurately and efficiently. This is where AI’s intervention phase has come to achieve vast significance. AI’s pattern recognition software and ability to derive deep insights based on past claims patterns from structured and unstructured data – claims notes, documents, third-party PDFs, and news articles – is helping configure unique insights that were hitherto often missed during claims registration. The gathering of such information is helping insurers predict claims trajectories in advance, allowing them to monitor the pulse of the allegations and the direction they are going in, and, from a business perspective, helping in better reserves management, risk assessment, and observation of annual trends.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl flex justify-center items-center\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/Standardization-of-FNOL-image4-1.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'contain', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}>\r\n                <img src=\"/blog-photos/p-n-c.webp\" height={'220'}/>\r\n            </div>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">IN CONVERSATION WITH BRAD METZGER, CLAIMS DIRECTOR</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Brad Metzger, having worked in the P&amp;C Industry for several years across Claims Operations, Claims Strategy, and Claims IT, has first-hand experience of the impact of AI during FNOL.

In essence, AI can be applied to two main things;Simplify mundane repetitive tasks that can relieve humans to perform other important things over time.Intervene in roles that demand a remarkable ability to sweep data, synthesize relevant information, and make decisions autonomously.In the claims process, for example, an insurer employs hundreds or thousands of claims handlers or analysts. On the surface, their job entails receiving claims filed by policyholders, reviewing them for red flags and referring them for further investigation if they appear suspicious, recommending them for closure if deserving, and assessing and segregating claims based on risks and reserves.The Claims Adjudication ProcessAs we dig deeper into an analyst’s role in the claims management process, we realize that the tasks need more than just being ticked off a dashboard. Each step in the claims adjudication process needs rapid decision-making. This can only be accomplished by asking the right questions and probing intelligently, at the right time, during the right moment of the process, to collect all relevant information and apply it to make decisions. Some of these questions in an auto insurance claim for example can be;Does the insured’s policy cover that claimed loss?Is complete loss covered or only partially?Is the loss the insurance company's responsibility, or can it be subrogated?Is there additional information that can be obtained from case notes that can influence the claim result, or is the policyholder required to be questioned to continue processing the claim?Does the claim seem suspicious, and is it coming from the policyholder’s mal-intention or a genuine case of possible misunderstanding of their policy?Questions like these and the decision to ask and research more by claims adjusters come together during the First Notice of Loss or FNOL once the claim is filed. Therefore, depending on the situation, complexity of the case, and the type of insurance (auto claims are adjudicated differently from med-claims), there are tons of decisions to be made in a short period, quickly and thoughtfully during the first few hours of reporting a loss. When multiplied by thousands of claims handlers doing similar tasks across various insurance companies and lines, this showcases the intellectual capital going into making decisions during the mindboggling process, combined with humungous amounts of data constantly generated.PARTS 12Written by: Dr. Charmaine Kenita\n\nTechnology and Business Writer\n\n",

When multiplied by thousands of claims handlers doing similar tasks across various insurance companies and lines, this showcases the intellectual capital going into making decisions during the mindboggling process, combined with humungous amounts of data constantly generated.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Request a Demo:</h3>\r\n            <form action=\"https://charlee.ai/ai-augments-not-replaces-human-experience-in-claims-management-part-1/\" method=\"post\" className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"firstname\" className=\"block\">First Name <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"text\" name=\"firstname\" id=\"firstname\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"First Name *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"lastname\" className=\"block\">Last Name <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"text\" name=\"lastname\" id=\"lastname\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"Last Name *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"phone_number\" className=\"block\">Phone Number</label>\r\n                        <input type=\"tel\" name=\"phone_number\" id=\"phone_number\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" placeholder=\"888-888-8888\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"email\" className=\"block\">Email <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" id=\"email\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"@email *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                    <p>I would like to:</p>\r\n                    <div className=\"flex flex-col\">\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Learn more about the Free POC *\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Learn more about the Free POC *\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Receive Product Information\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Receive Product Information\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Request a Demo\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Request a Demo\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"Receive your Whitepaper\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            Receive your Whitepaper\r\n                        </label>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"mt-4 text-right\">\r\n                    <button type=\"submit\" className=\"bg-teal-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded\">Submit</button>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </form>\r\n        </div>"

Treating others as one would like to be treated paves the way for small acts like kindness and equality to grow into empathy, fairness, and the absence of prejudice in decision-making at work and in our personal lives.Bias, however, is a natural human trait that creeps in across ages in whatever we do. As adults, we can become aware of it and ensure it doesn’t color our perspectives and way of life, but it is a natural trait which creeps into almost everything we make or create. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven systems - the creation of humans is also subject to the bias of their human creators. Often unwittingly, we bake biases into systems in how they are configured OR by training them based on biased data OR defining them by ‘rules’ created by experts with unconscious yet implicit biases. Knowing the inflection points at which biases can creep in can help create unbiased underlying AI algorithms, even if removing them entirely from our habituated minds seems impossible.Technology and machines, a product of human hands, are bound to be biased. Artificial intelligence humans create is bound to show biased traits.

Insurtech, with its cutting-edge AI solutions and techniques, is leading the charge in impacting every aspect of the insurance carrier’s work. The most profound is the transformation of the claims workflow at a speed that is both life-altering and innovative. The answer, therefore, lies in balancing what we feed into the AI system while maintaining the integrity of our standard processes and traditional systems to promote greater fairness and equality in every insurance task we undertake.What is Artificial Intelligence for Insurtech?AI is a branch of computer science devoted to developing data processing systems that perform reasoning, learning, and self-improvement functions, typically associated with human intelligence.  In simple terms, AI mimics the reasoning and problem-solving of the human mind. It helps streamline processes, injects predictability, automates systems, and simplifies complexity to ensure smooth functioning for different insurance stakeholders. Therefore, a task such as assessing smartphone photos in an auto insurance claim, which may take several minutes for a person, can be done in a matter of seconds by an AI system. With this technology, insurance is shifting from a ‘detect and repair’ model to a ‘predict and prevent’ one, transforming everything across the industry, from processes to workflows to decisions. Artificial intelligence is currently used to process claims, underwriting, fraud detection, and enhance the overall customer experience.Essentials of Trust in the Insurance DomainInsurance in the US goes back to the 1700s, first mandated by Benjamin Franklin. It has evolved from a labor-intensive process to one segmented and structured to ensure better, comprehensive coverage and customer interaction. Over the years, it has become a non-negotiable in various aspects of life, from health to travel. Besides stabilizing economies, insurers and policies are relied upon to safeguard and protect people’s lives and assets during loss or catastrophe. An intricately woven piece of society’s social and economic fabric, insurance is and has always been one of the most regulated and scrutinized industries, with trust forming the foundation on which it is based. For several decades now, there has been an inherent trust and relative transparency in the fundamentals of an insurance purchase. Purchasers know that if they live in a frequently disaster-affected area or have a history of speeding fines, premiums are high, and vice versa, with other factors considered. However, as insurers envision and accept proprietary advancements in AI and big data and consider the increase in insurance complexities, newer questions are emerging based on ethics and bias.Research suggests it is easier to program bias out of machines than human minds. An ever-growing society driven by human thinking faces rapidly changing dynamics across races, genders, and social statuses and how this is being addressed and approached. Questions like: Where is the ‘big data’ being used, how is it being used, what are the factors influencing significant language AI models, and their impact on premiums and coverage are all being asked. There is a growing effort to ensure it plays out fairly for all concerned, eliminating bias and putting measures in place to minimize it as much as possible. InsureTech companies must take disciplined measures to deliver on this expectation.What is Bias in Artificial Intelligence?The Oxford Dictionary of English (2nd Edition) defines bias as the inclination or prejudice for or against one person or group, especially unfairly. Bias is further defined as a systematic distortion of a statistical result due to a factor not allowed for in its derivation. So, what exactly is bias in the context of AI and data? It's like a hidden prejudice, unfairly favoring or disfavoring a particular person or group. In AI, this bias can sneak in and distort statistical results, like a sneaky factor that wasn't accounted for during its creation.It is a fact that humans are biased in their decision-making. Personal prejudices often seep into our decisions. The exposure and experience of upbringing change us, predisposing us towards a specific group of people while favorable to another. This can distort anything we do, distracting us from our core purpose. Research has shown that interviewers show a preference for specific candidates or that information from one case is misapplied to another.ConclusionRegarding using AI in insurance, there are several ways bias can creep in. The underlying data is one of the foremost sources of this bias. AI models may be trained on data based on human decisions or reflect a second-hand influence of social or historical inequities. How data is selected or collected can also let bias seep in. Recognizing and working on keeping bias out of insurance is fundamentally complex. The nature of insurance entails its need to be biased away from fundamental unreasonable risks to ensure financial feasibility. However, defining and measuring fairness parameters, putting regulatory frameworks and processes in place, and using ethical AI platforms that uphold the domain’s integrity while mitigating and governing unfair treatment and practice can go a long way in ensuring the insurance ecosystem comes together to work towards this.Written by: Dr. Charmaine Kenita\n\nTechnology and Business Writer\n\n",

    "content": "In part 1 of this 2 part series we examined how bias is fundamentally ingrained into any kind of technology or processes built by humans. Recognizing and working with it in every decision we take is the only way to address and minimize its influence on our business processes. A conscious approach to understanding and addressing bias begins from incorporating compliance and risk concerns into every aspect of the insurance process, from data handling and risk assessment to decision systems and stakeholder education. Insurers should continuously evaluate system performance, know when problems of bias arise, pre-empt and prepare to deal with them and configure steps to identify and course correct where necessary.Among the foremost factors that can affect the creeping of bias into existing business systems, is the role of regulation and compliance and the changes that are constantly being introduced into the regulatory landscape. Committing to fairness and transparency across the organization is a corporate responsibility. Managing AI risks like bias is a business and not just a technical or technological problem.The Current Regulatory LandscapeIn December 2023, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) published a Model Bulletin for regulating AI used by insurance companies<1>. To date, thirteen states have enacted regulations for the use of AI by insurance companies.  Charlee.ai contributed to developing and promulgating the Bulletin by providing training and expertise to the AI, Innovation, Big Data committees and various state insurance departments. Charlee.ai continues to work with the NAIC committees and regulators to provide technology and domain expertise for AI in insurance workflows.<1>https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/2023-12-4%20Model%20Bulletin_Adopted_0.pdfStandards that Define Charlee’s Prevention of Bias in AI Large Language ModelsInsurance and trust being fundamentally interwoven, ensuring fairness and transparency in using AI platforms, is a corporate responsibility that must be adhered to at all times. Charlee™ has developed a set of techniques and standards for ensuring buyers' trust, and monitoring the element of bias that may creep in anywhere during the AI intervention cycle. Below are a few critical insights from our thought leadership about the AI platform one chooses to use. Be careful what goes into the AI’s Large Language Models: Building the AI system entails considering certain factors that go into the build. Machine learning models continuously learn patterns based on whatever they are trained on or fed into them. Prominent columns like zip code, claimant race, gender, etc. should be avoided. However, sometimes bias may creep up unexpectedly when other columns used as model inputs correlate highly with protected classes, effectively making those columns proxies for the protected classes. When choosing input columns for a model, it is essential to continuously test them for correlations with protected classes and potential bias. Test the outputs for bias:Testing the platform and its outputs for bias consistently ensures that the results are not unnecessarily influenced or altered during the analysis. It is essential to do a correlation analysis of the language and machine learning (ML) model outputs against the columns in the data representing protected classes. Constant checks should be conducted to ensure that the distribution of the model outputs across the values in each of those columns is fair. Review the results with experts:In addition to doing bias testing, having a domain expert review the model predictions adds another layer of checks to ensure the analysis always remains bias-free. It is critical to have them read through a set of claims/data and provide their expert opinions on the model results. Any concerns brought up need to be promptly addressed and reviewed. Provide the language model with guard rails:Once expert inputs and reviews are received, it is important to use the inputs to define guard rails for the model. These can be used to train the model and continuously validate the model outputs. Also, having an ensemble of models that can be used helps in case the model output falls outside of the guard rails.Role of Stakeholder Collaboration in Eliminating BiasThe insurance ecosystem is built around a siloed framework where essential stakeholders are separated from one another based on their primary tasks, decision-making abilities, and depth of expertise. Human nature is prone to prejudice, which can creep into decision-making at any time. Similarly, in AI and other consequential decision systems, the technical nature of the work breaks it into siloes. Data scientists and engineers develop the systems, risk and compliance teams later evaluate them, and every stakeholder does it separately, owing to which bias can enter the system unknowingly.To combat this, it is critical for all stakeholders and technical and subject matter experts to work together with trust and transparency built into the order of work. Human processes and decisions surrounding the language model’s conception, development, and deployment have to come together to understand the goal, arrive at expected outcomes, and reason the model’s best possible solution for the business problem that must be addressed. Once the language and ML models are adopted, non-technical members need to find user-friendly ways to monitor, access, and understand the decisions made by the AI. Insurers must continuously evaluate system performance, know when biases arise, and address them efficiently, correcting course as needed.How Charlee.ai Models Have Been Developed to Minimize BiasThe Charlee AI platform is built within the regulatory compliance framework and overseen by insurance experts. It provides pre-trained models for AI-based claims analytics, including severity, litigation, attorney involvement predictions, and fraud indicators.1. Model inputs: Charlee severity, litigation, and suspicious claims models have been developed in close collaboration with domain experts who have vetted the models at every stage. Domain experts have helped define the model inputs and the ontologies that help train Charlee’s NLP models. We have carefully selected columns that capture the injury and damage severity, as well as behavioral patterns that are independent of the group (race, gender, etc.) that the claimant belongs to.2. Testing for bias: Charlee models are regularly and carefully tested with domain experts to prevent bias from creeping in. The model prediction distribution is weighed against the input data to ensure it is fair.3. Expert reviews: Our business analysts and data scientists carefully select a good distribution of anomalous and statistically conformant claims for review by domain experts. Our domain experts review the selected claims in detail and validate the predictions. Any issues they point out are promptly investigated.4. Guard rails: Charlee employs a library of models based on LOB and coverage. Domain expert inputs are used to define guard rails for the predictions. Models are carefully selected, and an ensemble is configured to ensure compliance.ConclusionBias can creep into AI models in various ways. Having an objective oversight and risk controls are best practices to follow when analyzing data models. Careful selection of model inputs, thorough tuning and testing, and close collaboration between domain experts, business analysts, and data scientists can help reduce model bias in AI. While it is human nature to be biased, insurers can do well to implement transparency, risk governance and objectivity with a clear intent to do the right thing.That’s why at Charlee.AI, we have defined, and employ these best practices that ensure compliance of our AI models.Written by: Dr. Charmaine Kenita\n\nTechnology and Business Writer\n\n",

Recognizing and working with it in every decision we take is the only way to address and minimize its influence on our business processes. A conscious approach to understanding and addressing bias begins from incorporating compliance and risk concerns into every aspect of the insurance process, from data handling and risk assessment to decision systems and stakeholder education. Insurers should continuously evaluate system performance, know when problems of bias arise, pre-empt and prepare to deal with them and configure steps to identify and course correct where necessary.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Among the foremost factors that can affect the creeping of bias into existing business systems, is the role of regulation and compliance and the changes that are constantly being introduced into the regulatory landscape. Committing to fairness and transparency across the organization is a corporate responsibility. Managing AI risks like bias is a business and not just a technical or technological problem.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/Charlee.ai-and-Reducing-Bias-in-Artificial-Intelligence-–-Part-2-Prevention-of-Bias-in-AI-Large-Language-Models.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'contain', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">The Current Regulatory Landscape</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">In December 2023, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) published a Model Bulletin for regulating AI used by insurance companies <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>. To date, thirteen states have enacted regulations for the use of AI by insurance companies. Charlee.ai contributed to developing and promulgating the Bulletin by providing training and expertise to the AI, Innovation, Big Data committees and various state insurance departments.

    "content": "Claims Director Brad Metzger has worked in the P&C Industry for several years, performing diverse roles in Claims Operations, Claims Strategy, and Claims IT. Having seen the rise of technology in claims management, he has a unique perspective in analyzing the potential of AI to significantly transform claims workflow management while validating it against emerging trends and risks. Below are his thoughts on how different stakeholders are impacted by AI and the takeaways on various aspects: how processes are eased, decisions simplified, and the role of analytics in bringing everything together.Charlee.ai: Brad, what constitutes a claims workflow?Brad Metzger: Claims workflow management involves steps that claimants and insurers must follow to resolve claims. These workflows are generally non-linear due to complexity and variability in each claim.  That said, it does involve checkpoints in a pre-defined process to simplify the adjuster’s journey ensuring predictability for all stakeholders while bringing the customer back to pre-loss condition. It also ensures due diligence is carried out, considering their rights at every step. Insurers must fulfil their obligation to receive, investigate, and act upon a claim filed by the insured and take it to its logical conclusion as quickly and efficiently as possible.In the real world, claims workflow management can be intricate, with various challenges and queries arising at every stage of the claims cycle. Frequently, insurers haven’t customized the process to map it to their deliverables despite following the universal pattern of how claims are dealt with. This can create chaos in the process;Essential data being missed during FNOL intakeDocuments not investigated despite being filed /receivedSpecific claims not investigated deeply despite arising from anomalies identified in the past and /or unusual patterns and behaviours.When ignored in the general management of things, these lapses can mean that significant insights are missing and can distort the way the claims investigation process flows.Correctly mapping the claims workflow, understanding the complexity and variability that each claim will present, can resolve several critical areas of claims processing. Add to this the profound and predictive pattern detection by AI-led, NLP-based analytics, and the results derived by the application can change how claims are managed to make the process sharper, better, faster, and more accurate.Charlee.ai: Brad, how can AI help ease and streamline claims workflows for the different stakeholders, such as Customers, Staff and Data Analysts including Data Engineers?Brad Metzger: AI impacts everyone in the claims management process, helping align claims workflows for different stakeholders, injecting predictability, assisting with decision-making, and acting as a cyber supervisor.            Customer and Staff—AI eases communication when deployed at the customer's first point of contact. It assists in automated claims submission (at FNOL) and ongoing bilateral communication between the customer and staff using online portals, chatbots, or mobile apps, employing NLP to accept, understand, and process information. It helps in the workflow management by;Ensuring less effort and more convenience for the customer. Reduces the need for human intervention and manual data entry. Eliminates the need for the claims personnel to complete mundane tasks, allowing them to focus on critical tasks required to adjudicate the claim.            Analysts – Data management is critical, but errors abound when done manually. AI helps efficiently manage large amounts of data to quickly analyze what’s impacting Service, Severity, and Productivity results. Analysts play a very crucial role in supporting the claims process.Acting as the CCO’s eyes and ears, they are responsible for addressing the factors that enables Adjusters to pay the right amount, at the right time, using the right amount of effort.Charlee.ai: Brad, please share examples of specific parts of the claims workflow that are helped by the intervention of insights and past trends (For example, data extraction and document routing).Brad Metzger: There are several critical milestones in processing a claim:FNOL – In any incident report and subsequent investigation, the basics must be addressed: Who? What? When? Why? Where? How?  These are all of the essential first steps for the FNOL to be completed. Data must be accurately and efficiently registered into the claims management system, where AI’s intervention is very significant. AI’s pattern recognition software and ability to derive deep insights based on past claims patterns from structured and unstructured data are helping insurers predict claims trajectories in advance, allowing them to monitor the pulse of the allegations and the direction the claim is going. To know more on this, read the blog on FNOL Standardization.Damage Assessment—Vehicle damage after an accident is now being efficiently assessed using an AI-powered computer vision system. The assessment includes physical damage and component wear and tear.Fraud Detection: AI uses real-time data to identify and predict fraudulent practices, providing alerts during the claims workflow. It also uses image analytics to detect inconsistencies and anomalies indicative of fraud.Predictive Analytics—AI is increasingly used to analyze historical data to predict claim outcomes. Pre-trained NLP applications are seamlessly integrated with claims dashboards, providing actionable insights while predicting the trajectory of the claim into litigation.Customer Communication—Communication is one of AI's foremost tasks naturally integrated into it. Chatbots increasingly used by insurers provide real-time updates and share information/documents, from the simplest asks to the most complex queries.Document Processing – Sifting through reams of documents manually and then realizing some detail that could have changed the outcome of the claim is missed, is a situation no insurer wants to be in. Here, AI can use OCR technology to extract information from documents, making it easier to process paperwork.Charlee.ai: Brad, what factors in the claims workflow tend to drive poor claims outcomes?Brad Metzger: While existing workflows are tried and tested, having come about from decades of learning, exploring, and practice, they have become repetitive and redundant and are slowing down the quick resolution of claims. In addition, several factors impact claims outcomes, such as the deluge of claims numbers, external volatility, economic upheavals, and other factors.Lengthy processing times – Delays frustrate customers who typically need to resolve the claim and get on with their life.Lack of communication – Lack of timely updates and understanding of the following steps can cause anxiety, leave people in the dark, and a build-up of resentment, causing the claims handling to become more complex.Inconsistent Service—Delivering the same kind of service inconsistently from one claims rep to another due to non-alignment with industry and company best practices, can cause customer discontent and escalate issues.Lack of empathy – A simple lack of understanding the other person’s point of view can lead to disagreement and dissatisfaction.Inaccurate assessment of damages—Several factors can lead to inaccuracy, one of the main reasons being hassled people who are overworked or overstressed and miss or ignore visible signs and texts in the claims data presented before them.Failing to follow up—Again, due to several factors, failure to follow up with the customer or any other provider responsible for servicing the customer (e.g., body shops, medical providers, etc.) can lead to miscommunication and missing crucial information that can impede or interfere with the claims management process.Charlee.ai: How does optimal management of such workflows help insurers and policyholders? What are the takeaways or benefits?Brad Metzger: Managing the claims workflows optimally begins from the FNOL when the claims are first reported, up to its resolution and various touchpoints. However, a claims workflow is progressing optimally when,It improves customer service and effort through quicker and more efficient settlements.Positively impacts paid severity (loss) and loss adjustment expenses (ULAE and ALAE). When workflows are redesigned and relooked at to minimize bottlenecks and streamline handoffs between different stages of the claims, the entire process ensures nothing is missed.Eliminating mundane, repetitive tasks encourages productivity gains (doing more work with fewer people) and allows people to manage more complex stages.Charlee.ai: Brad, can you provide two examples from your experience of Charlee streamlining claims workflows?Brad Metzger: In my experience with Charlee.ai, I have found NLP-based insights to significantly improve and manage claims portfolios. A single-pane view of all past and ongoing claims benefits everyone, gives updates on the general health of the claim portfolio, helps oversee reserve patterns, enhances the view of loss triangles, and provides many other proprietary key performance indicators (KPI) updates.AI lead analytics platforms enhance and optimize the “Standard Work” requirement (i.e., daily, weekly, and monthly tasks) for front-line supervisors. This improves focus on escalating claims involving high-cost or high-risk cases ‘very early’ in the life of a claim, akin to employing a Cyber-Supervisor or AI-led “virtual assistant.”Automatic triage of ‘all’ claims based on risk level without human intervention. The claims workflow process will be optimized when the right Claim Adjuster handles the proper claim, particularly on high-risk claims. This optimizes time utilization, hastens resolution, and prevents escalation leading to complex claims. It also eliminates the rerouting or reassigning of lower complexity claims. Charlee.ai: Brad, how is the humungous amount of data generated from litigation perfectly aligned for AI to function and help grab insights from it?Brad Metzger: AI is built to analyze large data sets and can quickly identify patterns and extract actionable and meaningful insights, resulting in ability to:Enhance and optimize decision-making processes for Litigation Adjusters and Legal Professionals when outlining claim-level strategies.Predict likely outcomes based on historical data.Detect inconsistencies and unusual patterns in data which is crucial for identifying potential direct or indirect fraud. Charlee.ai: Brad, are there any surprising and unforeseen benefits of AI in streamlining and standardizing claims processes?Brad Metzger: Yes! AI provides accuracy and efficiency gains in the claims process, which can enhance reserving best practices within the claims organization. This is achieved chiefly by leveraging advanced data processing to best predict outcomes.A surprising outcome of applying Charlee to one of our claims processes was reserving accuracy. This was not a KPI, which we agreed on measures at the outset, but it ended up being a strategic insight and value-added consequence. Sharing the insights with the Enterprise Actuarial, Underwriting, and Pricing teams allowed them to enhance several existing risk models.Written by: Brad Metzger Claims DirectorandDr. Charmaine Kenita\n\nTechnology and Business Writer\n\n\n\nREQUEST A DEMO:\n\n",

In addition, several factors impact claims outcomes, such as the deluge of claims numbers, external volatility, economic upheavals, and other factors.</p>\r\n            <ul className=\"mt-4 list-disc list-inside\">\r\n                <li><strong>Lengthy processing times</strong> – Delays frustrate customers who typically need to resolve the claim and get on with their life.</li>\r\n                <li><strong>Lack of communication</strong> – Lack of timely updates and understanding of the following steps can cause anxiety, leave people in the dark, and a build-up of resentment, causing the claims handling to become more complex.</li>\r\n                <li><strong>Inconsistent Service</strong>—Delivering the same kind of service inconsistently from one claims rep to another due to non-alignment with industry and company best practices, can cause customer discontent and escalate issues.</li>\r\n                <li><strong>Lack of empathy</strong> – A simple lack of understanding the other person’s point of view can lead to disagreement and dissatisfaction.</li>\r\n                <li><strong>Inaccurate assessment of damages</strong>—Several factors can lead to inaccuracy, one of the main reasons being hassled people who are overworked or overstressed and miss or ignore visible signs and texts in the claims data presented before them.</li>\r\n                <li><strong>Failing to follow up</strong>—Again, due to several factors, failure to follow up with the customer or any other provider responsible for servicing the customer (e.g., body shops, medical providers, etc.) can lead to miscommunication and missing crucial information that can impede or interfere with the claims management process.</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl mt-4\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/Guest-Speak-Part-3-contd.-AI-in-Claims-–-Workflow-Management-image5.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Charlee.ai: How does optimal management of such workflows help insurers and policyholders? What are the takeaways or benefits?</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><strong>Brad Metzger:</strong> Managing the claims workflows optimally begins from the FNOL when the claims are first reported, up to its resolution and various touchpoints. However, a claims workflow is progressing optimally when,</p>\r\n            <ul className=\"mt-4 list-disc list-inside\">\r\n                <li>It improves customer service and effort through quicker and more efficient settlements.</li>\r\n                <li>Positively impacts paid severity (loss) and loss adjustment expenses (ULAE and ALAE). When workflows are redesigned and relooked at to minimize bottlenecks and streamline handoffs between different stages of the claims, the entire process ensures nothing is missed.</li>\r\n                <li>Eliminating mundane, repetitive tasks encourages productivity gains (doing more work with fewer people) and allows people to manage more complex stages.</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Charlee.ai: Brad, can you provide two examples from your experience of Charlee streamlining claims workflows?</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><strong>Brad Metzger:</strong> In my experience with Charlee.ai, I have found NLP-based insights to significantly improve and manage claims portfolios. A single-pane view of all past and ongoing claims benefits everyone, gives updates on the general health of the claim portfolio, helps oversee reserve patterns, enhances the view of loss triangles, and provides many other proprietary key performance indicators (KPI) updates.</p>\r\n            <ul className=\"mt-4 list-disc list-inside\">\r\n                <li>AI lead analytics platforms enhance and optimize the “Standard Work” requirement (i.e., daily, weekly, and monthly tasks) for front-line supervisors. This improves focus on escalating claims involving high-cost or high-risk cases <strong>‘very early’</strong> in the life of a claim, akin to employing a Cyber-Supervisor or AI-led “virtual assistant.”</li>\r\n                <li>Automatic triage of ‘<strong>all</strong>’ claims based on risk level without human intervention. The claims workflow process will be optimized when the right Claim Adjuster handles the proper claim, particularly on high-risk claims. This optimizes time utilization, hastens resolution, and prevents escalation leading to complex claims. It also eliminates the rerouting or reassigning of lower complexity claims.</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Charlee.ai: Brad, how is the humungous amount of data generated from litigation perfectly aligned for AI to function and help grab insights from it?</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><strong>Brad Metzger:</strong> AI is built to analyze large data sets and can quickly identify patterns and extract actionable and meaningful insights, resulting in ability to:</p>\r\n            <ul className=\"mt-4 list-disc list-inside\">\r\n                <li>Enhance and optimize decision-making processes for Litigation Adjusters and Legal Professionals when outlining claim-level strategies.</li>\r\n                <li>Predict likely outcomes based on historical data.</li>\r\n                <li>Detect inconsistencies and unusual patterns in data which is crucial for identifying potential direct or indirect fraud.</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Charlee.ai: Brad, are there any surprising and unforeseen benefits of AI in streamlining and standardizing claims processes?</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><strong>Brad Metzger:</strong> Yes! AI provides accuracy and efficiency gains in the claims process, which can enhance reserving best practices within the claims organization. This is achieved chiefly by leveraging advanced data processing to best predict outcomes.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">A surprising outcome of applying Charlee to one of our claims processes was reserving accuracy. This was not a KPI, which we agreed on measures at the outset, but it ended up being a strategic insight and value-added consequence. Sharing the insights with the Enterprise Actuarial, Underwriting, and Pricing teams allowed them to enhance several existing risk models.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">About the Authors</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><strong>Written by: Brad Metzger</strong></p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><em>Claims Director</em></p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><strong>and</strong></p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><strong>Dr. Charmaine Kenita</strong></p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><em>Technology and Business Writer</em></p>\r\n\r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Request a Demo:</h3>\r\n            <form action=\"https://charlee.ai/guest-speak-part-3-ai-in-claims-speed-to-market-with-artificial-intelligence-workflows/\" method=\"post\" className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"firstname\" className=\"block\">First Name <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"text\" name=\"firstname\" id=\"firstname\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"First Name *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"lastname\" className=\"block\">Last Name <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"text\" name=\"lastname\" id=\"lastname\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"Last Name *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"phone_number\" className=\"block\">Phone Number</label>\r\n                        <input type=\"tel\" name=\"phone_number\" id=\"phone_number\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" placeholder=\"888-888-8888\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <label htmlFor=\"email\" className=\"block\">Email <abbr title=\"required\">*</abbr></label>\r\n                        <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" id=\"email\" className=\"w-full border rounded p-2\" required placeholder=\"@email *\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                    <p>What Products Are You Interested In?</p>\r\n                    <div className=\"flex flex-col\">\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"LITIGATION MANAGMENT DASHBOARD\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            LITIGATION MANAGMENT DASHBOARD\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"SEVERITY MANAGMENT DASHBOARD\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            SEVERITY MANAGMENT DASHBOARD\r\n                        </label>\r\n                        <label>\r\n                            <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"product[]\" value=\"CLAIMS PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DASHBOARD\" className=\"mr-2\" />\r\n                            CLAIMS PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DASHBOARD\r\n                        </label>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"mt-4 text-right\">\r\n                    <button type=\"submit\" className=\"bg-teal-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded\">Submit</button>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </form>\r\n        </div>"

The beginning and pace at which a sport is set is where champions are made, championships are won, and careers get going. Track and field enthusiasts know how positive outcomes get a sprinter out of the blocks when the starter’s pistol shot is fired or how a swimmer’s lead in a race is set based on the kind of edge they can establish during the first lap. In claims management, the first few hours after an accident, a calamity, or loss provide the vital period required to gather data, establish facts, and chalk the incident's trajectory, setting the tone for the entire claims management cycle to unfold. This phase, called The First Notice of Loss (FNOL), must be flawless in gathering data and establishing what and how the incident happened, communicating the next steps to the customer, and assessing all possible exposures or applicable coverages.Claimant and third-party details, including past and present claims histories.Possibility of attorney involvement in cases of litigation and contended claims.Reserves are to be set aside for claims payout and management.Assessment of low, medium, or high-risk claims.Insights and behaviors that may influence pricing or settlements.THE IMPORTANCE OF FNOLThe first time the claimant informs the insurer of a loss, is when it is considered ‘making a claim.’ This is when the lifecycle of a formal claim begins and is very crucial both for the claimant and insurer. In the case of the former, it establishes the result of the policy the claimant has paid for and whether his claim will be dealt with swiftly, immediately, and within an adequate response time. In the case of the latter, it is a chance for the insurer to prove or validate their reputation in handling the claims quickly, ensuring a good resolution and justified settlement.Registering an FNOL requires the insurer to submit critical information - policy number, date and time of the loss, incident location, police report number, a personal account of how the incident occurred, and insurance information of the other party where required. In the case of a car accident, details given to an FNOL representative will include all the above, as well as questions about the nature and severity of the damage, history of the claimant, other driver’s testimony, police reports, witness accounts, medical report if any, observed damage to vehicles, etc.ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INSIGHTS – THE GAME CHANGERIn any incident report and subsequent investigation, the basics must be addressed: Who? What? When? Why? Where? And How? For the FNOL to be complete, this essential data must be registered and admitted into the claims management system accurately and efficiently. This is where AI's intervention phase has come to achieve vast significance. AI’s pattern recognition software and ability to derive deep insights based on past claims patterns from structured and unstructured data – claims notes, documents, third-party PDFs, and news articles – is helping configure unique insights that were hitherto often missed during claims registration. The gathering of such information is helping insurers predict claims trajectories in advance, allowing them to monitor the pulse of the allegations and the direction they are going in, and, from a business perspective, helping in better reserves management, risk assessment, and observation of annual trends.IN CONVERSATION WITH BRAD METZGER, CLAIMS DIRECTORBrad Metzger, having worked in the P&C Industry for several years across Claims Operations, Claims Strategy, and Claims IT, has first-hand experience of the impact of AI during FNOL. Having observed the insurance industry for over two decades and observing the criticality of data insights by AI intervention in claims management, he sheds light on why FNOL standardization using NLP-led AI engines can make the claims management process sharper, better, and more intelligent.Question: Brad, how important is the standardization of FNOL, and how can AI impact it during the claims process?The FNOL standardization is an essential part of claims management and must include the ability to connect to the insurance company virtually. Connecting IoT devices, such as crash detection and connected homes, makes the whole process seamless and sharp. This is what drives the value.Question: How do quick insights during FNOL, impact insurers and policyholders?The FNOL is when the first insights are gathered from the insured and people involved in the incident. Many seen and unseen insights can impact the trajectory of the claims in the future, ‘if and when’ picked up at this stage. Getting the loss details immediately after the loss helps insurers triage better based on customer needs. The earlier the data is gathered, the better it becomes to understand how insurers need to respond to the claimant, all in an effort to reduce the human trauma associated with the loss. This impacts both expenses and claims severity, especially in high-risk claims.Question: What interventions can AI do at this stage to speed up the claims process or identify critical data that may have been missed?Once the claims are registered, the insurer’s goal is to quickly meet and exceed the expectations of all constituents in the claims process, as the adjudication process has already started. This will result in happy customers, smiling faces, and mitigation of unnecessary indemnity and expense costs. More importantly, AI intervention can predict claims severity and the likelihood of social inflation factors such as attorney representation/litigation and get a jump start on posting accurate reserves.Question: What is the fallout of unfavorable outcomes during the claims process? How does it impact the insured and the insurer?Any delay or failure to gather relevant insights during the FNOL can increase claims cycle times and expenses, indemnity severity and also negatively impact the overall customer experience.  Question: How do AI engines like Charlee™ help with the FNOL standardization? How can they streamline, simplify, and wrap up the claims management lifecycle?We have already established that the FNOL is the most crucial stage of the claim’s lifecycle. Getting as much information in this stage as possible will help ease several future processes, reduce cycle times, help better risk assessments, and predict claims severity well in advance.Charlee provides an NLP-driven claims summary, insights and predictions. This identifies gaps in information gathered, high priority claims for intelligent routing and assignment including workflow prioritization. An AI engine like Charlee is pre-trained for personal, automobile, and commercial insurance lines, picking insights from structured and unstructured data during FNOL and aiding claims analysts and managers with strategic insights and quantitative predictions to make real-time decisions while understanding and foreseeing user behavior patterns.Charlee.ai predicts litigation 90-120 days in advance with approximately 85% accuracy, starting at the First Notice of Loss (FNOL).Written by: Brad Metzger Claims DirectorandDr. Charmaine Kenita\n\nTechnology and Business Writer\n\n\n\nREQUEST A DEMO:\n\n",

Having observed the insurance industry for over two decades and observing the criticality of data insights by AI intervention in claims management, he sheds light on why FNOL standardization using NLP-led AI engines can make the claims management process sharper, better, and more intelligent.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><strong>Question: Brad, how important is the standardization of FNOL, and how can AI impact it during the claims process?</strong></p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">The FNOL standardization is an essential part of claims management and must include the ability to connect to the insurance company virtually. Connecting IoT devices, such as crash detection and connected homes, makes the whole process seamless and sharp. This is what drives the value.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><strong>Question: How do quick insights during FNOL, impact insurers and policyholders?</strong></p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">The FNOL is when the first insights are gathered from the insured and people involved in the incident. Many seen and unseen insights can impact the trajectory of the claims in the future, ‘if and when’ picked up at this stage. Getting the loss details immediately after the loss helps insurers triage better based on customer needs. The earlier the data is gathered, the better it becomes to understand how insurers need to respond to the claimant, all in an effort to reduce the human trauma associated with the loss. This impacts both expenses and claims severity, especially in high-risk claims.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><strong>Question: What interventions can AI do at this stage to speed up the claims process or identify critical data that may have been missed?</strong></p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Once the claims are registered, the insurer’s goal is to quickly meet and exceed the expectations of all constituents in the claims process, as the adjudication process has already started. This will result in happy customers, smiling faces, and mitigation of unnecessary indemnity and expense costs. More importantly, AI intervention can predict claims severity and the likelihood of social inflation factors such as attorney representation/litigation and get a jump start on posting accurate reserves.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/PATH-TO-IMPROVING-FIRST-NOTICE-OF-LOSS-FNOL-WITH-AI-web-image3.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">CONCLUSION</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Any delay or failure to gather relevant insights during the FNOL can increase claims cycle times and expenses, indemnity severity and also negatively impact the overall customer experience. Getting as much information in this stage as possible will help ease several future processes, reduce cycle times, help better risk assessments, and predict claims severity well in advance.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Charlee provides an NLP-driven claims summary, insights and predictions.

    "content": "Artificial Intelligence is ubiquitous in everyday tasks in today’s busy life, inseparable from Mac and Cheese or Uber and travel. It simplifies how our needs are met and addressed, from being integrated into driverless automobiles to being indispensable in mental health apps and taking over the basic tasks in business, work, and even personal lives. AI was built to aid and extract intelligence from data to foresee, predict, and give meaningful insights that can facilitate or ease human tasks.Built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and deep learning techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and convolutional neural networks, artificial intelligence is slowly fulfilling its promise of reasoning, learning, perceiving, and problem-solving for humans.  When applied to a volatile and high-risk industry like insurance, AI is transforming the way we intervene in everyday processes, from claims management to litigation management, while shifting the industry from the current “react and respond” phase to more of a “predict and prevent” strategy to ensure better preparedness. The pace at which AI is taking over is already accelerating, which will be further fuelled by stakeholders such as brokers, attorneys, financial diaries, policyholders-, and insurers becoming more attuned to the benefits of technology and the ways decision-making, productivity, and customer experience are getting enhanced.To understand how AI helps further the insurance industry and becomes deeply integrated into everyday processes, carriers must be the foremost people in a position to address and respond to the changing business landscape. This is especially true given that AI reshapes everyday insurance processes like claims, underwriting, distribution, and pricing.Machine Learning and its Key IndicatorsUnderstanding technology requires knowing what drives it, and this is where the conceptual basis of machine learning comes into play. By its very definition, machine learning works on algorithms or rules and processes that perform tasks. These algorithms are pre-trained based on their intended purpose to determine certain classifications or make predictions while uncovering key insights in individual data mining projects. Thus, they perform tasks that analyze data to predict trends and help us make decisions.Accuracy, precision, and recall are the three key indicators that help evaluate the quality of classification models in machine learning. Each metric assesses a different element of the model’s quality. Although their significance varies from one use case to another, they can be measured, and their impact can be calculated to understand how good an AI engine is and what work it does.What are Classification Models?Classification models assign a pre-determined label to a set of objects in the input data. For example, your requirement as a claims manager may be to know whether a bunch of claims in a particular jurisdiction required attorney intervention. An ML model can then classify all users into ‘Intervene’ and ‘Not Intervene’ categories. Once the actual labels are determined, it is easy to measure the quality of the classification model based on accuracy, precision, and recall.To summarize;Accuracy is the overall correctness of a classification ML modelPrecision defines how often a model is correct when predicting a target classRecall is when an ML model can find all objects of the target class.1.\tACCURACYAccuracy is a crucial metric critical for classification models. It defines how often an ML model correctly predicts the outcome. This metric can be obtained by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions made. Accuracy defines how often the model is accurate.Accuracy is measurable on a scale of 0 to 1 or as a percentage. The higher the accuracy, the better the model. A perfect accuracy of 1.0 is achieved when every prediction the model makes is accurate.This method of calculating accuracy aligns with our general understanding of this metric. Humans have an intuitive perception of accuracy, which helps us assess the model’s ability to classify data points correctly.Explaining this metric through a business example sheds more light on its application.Let us take an example of severity prediction on insurance claims. At a macro level, let's say you train a model to predict the severity of a claim using one of three labels - low, medium, and high. Low severity is anywhere from $0 to $25K. Medium severity is $25K to $100K, and high severity is over $100K. You present 1000 claims to the model for prediction, and you know the outcomes of each of those 1000 claims. Let's assume that the severity ranges across the claims are evenly distributed, with 400 claims at low severity, 300 at medium, and 300 at high. The model makes its prediction on each of the 1000 claims. We would count all the correct predictions and divide by 1000 to measure the model's accuracy. For example, among the 400 known low severity claims, the model predicts 340 of them to be low severity; among the 300 medium severity claims, it predicts 280 at medium severity; and it correctly predicts 250 out of the 300 high severity claims. Total number of claims correctly predicted is 340 + 280 + 250 = 870. Model accuracy is (870/1000)*100 = 87%.As straightforward as accuracy is in its measurement of judging model quality and showing overall correctness, this measure is not always unbiased or valuable.Accuracy Paradox – The downside to treating accuracy as a primary metric is that all classes are treated equally, and only correct predictions are looked at.When two different data classes with reasonably well-balanced datasets come together, accuracy as a metric is beneficial. However, real-world applications in the insurance domain have a high imbalance of classes. If one category has higher occurrences or frequent ones, there is an imbalance in the way accuracy is measured. These generic events can be predicted accurately in bodily injury or fraud cases. However, predicting bodily injuries with a pre-existing autoimmune illness or accident claim are event sets that rarely occur. This class imbalance due to their niche or specific criteria can mean the accuracy metric needs to assess classifications correctly. Explaining this metric through a business example sheds more light on its application.Let's take an example of a model that predicts litigation likelihood on claims. In the homeowner’s line of business, only about 2-4% of the claims end up in litigation. Say you provide a book of 1000 homeowners claims, with known outcomes, to the model for prediction. In that book, you have 24 claims that ended up in litigation. Your data scientist has unknowingly trained a naive model that almost always predicts litigation likelihood as \"no\" for every claim. When presented with, the book of 1000 claims, it predicts every single claim as unlikely to go into litigation. Guess what, it got 976 of the right! So, the model's accuracy is 97.6%. However, most claims managers will agree that this model is useless, although the data scientist is very excited about the accuracy.Positives of Accuracy Metric:Accuracy is a helpful metric for balanced classes. It helps to underline overall model correctness, but not for specific data classes.Everyone understands accuracy, and it is easy to comprehend and explain.Negatives of Accuracy Metric:Accuracy is misleading regarding misbalanced data classes and may disguise the overall asset class as low performance based on this.2.\tPRECISIONThis metric predicts how often the machine learning model correctly predicts the positive class. In lay terms, it means getting it right every time. It can be calculated by dividing true positives or the number of correct optimistic predictions by the total number of true and false positives—instances the model predicted as positive.Precision is measurable on a scale of 0 to 1 or as a percentage. The higher the precision, the better the model. A perfect precision of 1.0 is achieved when every prediction of the target class made by the model is correct, and nothing is flagged as an error.Explaining this metric through a business example sheds more light on its application.Let's go back to the litigation prediction use case. Your data scientist understands their fallacy and retrains the model. This time, the model predicts some claims will go into litigation. Let's say the new model now predicted eight claims as likely to go into litigation. Seven out of those eight claims did indeed go into litigation. The model missed predicting 17 of the litigation claims, but that is a topic of discussion in the next section. The model correctly predicted 7 out of 8 and thus has a precision of 87.5%.The earlier model (87% accurate) has a precision of 0% since it predicted 0 claims for litigation.Positives of Precision Metric:Precision works well for imbalanced classes, demonstrating the model's correctness in identifying the target class.Precision is also functional when the cost of false positives is high, and you need to be confident in the results’ identification of the target classes.Negatives of Accuracy Metric:One drawback of precision is that it cannot consider false negatives. It does not account for cases where the target event is missed.3.\tRECALLThis metric measures how often a machine learning model correctly identifies positive instances or true positives from all the actual positive dataset samples. It is calculated by dividing the number of true positives by the overall positive instances.Recall is measurable on a scale of 0 to 1 or as a percentage. The higher the recall, the better the model. A perfect recall of 1.0 is achieved when all instances of the target class in the model can be found in the dataset.Explaining this metric through a business example sheds more light on its application.Let's go back to our litigation prediction example. The new model trained by the data scientist identified 7 of the 24 claims that went into litigation. Therefore, its recall is 29%. Your data scientist now trains a third model that predicts 50 claims to go into litigation. 23 of the 24 litigated claims are part of these 50 claims. This third model has a recall of 23/24 = 96%. However, its precision will suffer. Of the 50 claims it predicted for litigation, only 23 ended up in litigation. Hence, its precision is 23/50 = 46%.Positives of Precision Metric:Regarding imbalanced classes, recall works well with such problems because of its focus on the model’s ability to find the target class objects.When the cost of false negatives is too high, recall is used.Negatives of Accuracy Metric:One of the drawbacks of recall is that it does not account for the cost of false positives.Explaining this metric through a business example sheds more light on its application.Let's go back to our litigation prediction example. The new model trained by the data scientist identified 7 of the 24 claims that went into litigation. Therefore, its recall is 29%. Your data scientist now trains a third model that predicts 50 claims to go into litigation. 23 of the 24 litigated claims are part of these 50 claims. This third model has a recall of 23/24 = 96%. However, its precision will suffer. Of the 50 claims it predicted for litigation, only 23 ended up in litigation. Hence, its precision is 23/50 = 46%.What do you think is better: Accuracy, Prediction, or Recall?Whether accuracy, precision, or recall is a better metric depends on your use case.Accuracy is a good metric when your different data classes are well balanced, and it is equally important in your use to identify each of the classes. For example, let's say you have three adjusters in your team skilled in handling different claims. Jordan is adept at handling low-severity claims, Alex is great with medium-severity claims, and Taylor does an excellent job with high-severity claims. You want to use your model's severity prediction for automated adjuster assignment. Any claims predicted for low severity will automatically get assigned to Jordan, medium to Alex, and high to Taylor. In this case, each of the 3 data classes is equally important, and assuming the data classes are balanced, accuracy will be the right metric to use.Precision is an excellent metric when your use case is tolerant to false negatives but sensitive to false positives. Say your use case is to identify claims likely to go into litigation and get your defense counsel to jump on them quickly. Even if you can identify and address just a few litigation-like claims, that's a big win. You don't care how many litigated claims you miss at this stage, but what matters is wanting to catch a handful. However, your defense counsel is an expensive resource, and the cost of sending a claim to them that is unlikely to go into litigation is very high. In such a scenario, precision is the more critical metric.Recall is an excellent metric to use when your use case is tolerant to false positives but sensitive to false negatives. Returning to the litigation prediction use case, say your defense counsel is in-house and can effectively handle a relatively large volume of claims thrown at them. There is no added cost per claim. You now want to catch as many litigation-like claims as possible and address them early on. Even one claim missed can get expensive as your jurisdiction is very litigious and plaintiff-friendly. In such a use case, recall is the more critical metric.Pick the most critical metric based on your use case, and ensure the model provides a reasonable value for the other metrics. For example, a model that predicts almost all claims to go into litigation will have 100% recall but 1% precision. This model only provides a little value since it dramatically increases the workload of the adjuster and defense counsel. A model that offers 88% recall with 65% precision will, in most cases, work better for the last use case above than the 100% recall with 1% precision model.This brings us to other model metrics, such as the F1 score and other custom metrics that may be more relevant to the use case. Defining and selecting custom metrics is a topic for another blog.CONCLUSIONMetrics such as accuracy, prediction, and recall are crucial for continuously evaluating the performance of an ML model. Either taken jointly or choosing one that is more suitable than the other, one can address different unique scenarios. In the case of the Charlee AI platform, our KPIs for various use cases are defined by weighing the model for particular scenarios and qualitatively checking them against these metrics.Written by: Dr. Charmaine Kenita \n\nTechnology and Business Writer\n\n\n\nREQUEST A DEMO:\n\n",

However, real-world applications in the insurance domain have a high imbalance of classes.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/Understanding-Accuracy-in-Machine-Learning-image3.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">2. PRECISION</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">This metric predicts how often the machine learning model correctly predicts the positive class. In lay terms, it means getting it right every time. It can be calculated by dividing true positives or the number of correct optimistic predictions by the total number of true and false positives—instances the model predicted as positive.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Precision is measurable on a scale of 0 to 1 or as a percentage. The higher the precision, the better the model. A perfect precision of 1.0 is achieved when every prediction of the target class made by the model is correct, and nothing is flagged as an error.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><em>Explaining this metric through a business example sheds more light on its application.</em></p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Let’s go back to the litigation prediction use case. Your data scientist understands their fallacy and retrains the model. This time, the model predicts some claims will go into litigation. Let’s say the new model now predicted eight claims as likely to go into litigation. Seven out of those eight claims did indeed go into litigation. The model missed predicting 17 of the litigation claims, but that is a topic of discussion in the next section. The model correctly predicted 7 out of 8 and thus has a precision of 87.5%.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">The earlier model (87% accurate) has a precision of 0% since it predicted 0 claims for litigation.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Positives of Precision Metric:</h3>\r\n            <ul className=\"mt-4 list-disc list-inside\">\r\n                <li>Precision works well for imbalanced classes, demonstrating the model’s correctness in identifying the target class.</li>\r\n                <li>Precision is also functional when the cost of false positives is high, and you need to be confident in the results’ identification of the target classes.</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Negatives of Precision Metric:</h3>\r\n            <ul className=\"mt-4 list-disc list-inside\">\r\n                <li>One drawback of precision is that it cannot consider false negatives. It does not account for cases where the target event is missed.</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">3. RECALL</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">This metric measures how often a machine learning model correctly identifies positive instances or true positives from all the actual positive dataset samples. It is calculated by dividing the number of true positives by the overall positive instances.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Recall is measurable on a scale of 0 to 1 or as a percentage. The higher the recall, the better the model. A perfect recall of 1.0 is achieved when all instances of the target class in the model can be found in the dataset.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/Understanding-Accuracy-in-Machine-Learning-image3-2.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            \r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><em>Explaining this metric through a business example sheds more light on its application.</em></p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Let’s go back to our litigation prediction example. The new model trained by the data scientist identified 7 of the 24 claims that went into litigation. Therefore, its recall is 29%. Your data scientist now trains a third model that predicts 50 claims to go into litigation. 23 of the 24 litigated claims are part of these 50 claims. This third model has a recall of 23/24 = 96%. However, its precision will suffer. Of the 50 claims it predicted for litigation, only 23 ended up in litigation. Hence, its precision is 23/50 = 46%.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Positives of Recall Metric:</h3>\r\n            <ul className=\"mt-4 list-disc list-inside\">\r\n                <li>Regarding imbalanced classes, recall works well with such problems because of its focus on the model’s ability to find the target class objects.</li>\r\n                <li>When the cost of false negatives is too high, recall is used.</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">Negatives of Recall Metric:</h3>\r\n            <ul className=\"mt-4 list-disc list-inside\">\r\n                <li>One of the drawbacks of recall is that it does not account for the cost of false positives.</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"w-full min-h-[400px] md:min-h-[500px] rounded-xl\" style={{background: `url(/blog-photos/Understanding-Accuracy-in-Machine-Learning-image4.webp)`, backgroundSize: 'contain', backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat' }}></div>\r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">What do you think is better: Accuracy, Precision, or Recall?</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Whether accuracy, precision, or recall is a better metric depends on your use case.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><strong>Accuracy</strong> is a good metric when your different data classes are well balanced, and it is equally important in your use to identify each of the classes. For example, let’s say you have three adjusters in your team skilled in handling different claims. Jordan is adept at handling low-severity claims, Alex is great with medium-severity claims, and Taylor does an excellent job with high-severity claims. You want to use your model’s severity prediction for automated adjuster assignment. Any claims predicted for low severity will automatically get assigned to Jordan, medium to Alex, and high to Taylor. In this case, each of the 3 data classes is equally important, and assuming the data classes are balanced, accuracy will be the right metric to use.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><strong>Precision</strong> is an excellent metric when your use case is tolerant to false negatives but sensitive to false positives. Say your use case is to identify claims likely to go into litigation and get your defense counsel to jump on them quickly. Even if you can identify and address just a few litigation-like claims, that’s a big win. You don’t care how many litigated claims you miss at this stage, but what matters is wanting to catch a handful. However, your defense counsel is an expensive resource, and the cost of sending a claim to them that is unlikely to go into litigation is very high. In such a scenario, precision is the more critical metric.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><strong>Recall</strong> is an excellent metric to use when your use case is tolerant to false positives but sensitive to false negatives. Returning to the litigation prediction use case, say your defense counsel is in-house and can effectively handle a relatively large volume of claims thrown at them. There is no added cost per claim. You now want to catch as many litigation-like claims as possible and address them early on. Even one claim missed can get expensive as your jurisdiction is very litigious and plaintiff-friendly. In such a use case, recall is the more critical metric.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Pick the most critical metric based on your use case, and ensure the model provides a reasonable value for the other metrics. For example, a model that predicts almost all claims to go into litigation will have 100% recall but 1% precision. This model only provides a little value since it dramatically increases the workload of the adjuster and defense counsel. A model that offers 88% recall with 65% precision will, in most cases, work better for the last use case above than the 100% recall with 1% precision model.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">This brings us to other model metrics, such as the F1 score and other custom metrics that may be more relevant to the use case. Defining and selecting custom metrics is a topic for another blog.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">CONCLUSION</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\">Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are crucial for continuously evaluating the performance of an ML model. Either taken jointly or choosing one that is more suitable than the other, one can address different unique scenarios. In the case of the Charlee AI platform, our KPIs for various use cases are defined by weighing the model for particular scenarios and qualitatively checking them against these metrics.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-[22px] font-bold\">About the Author</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><strong>Dr. Charmaine Kenita</strong></p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-4\"><em>Technology and Business Writer</em></p>\r\n        </div>"
